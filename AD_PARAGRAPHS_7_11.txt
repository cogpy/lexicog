AD 7.1
During or about mid June 2025, our accountant (for the corporations aforesaid, being the third to sixth respondents) attended to our oﬃce (Mr Daniel Jacobus Bantjes), so that provisional tax and VAT submissions could be ﬁnalised. His conﬁrmatory aﬃdavit, which conﬁrms this and the further information in his knowledge (set out in this aﬃdavit), is attached hereto marked "PF6".
AD 7.2
He noted, following his attendance, and during July 2025, numerous discrepancies in the applicant corporations' banking accounts, and numerous irregular payments therefrom, with which I deal in the paragraphs below.
AD 7.3
Those payments all seemed to relate to IT (Information Technology) related expenses, based on the nomenclature, and names of the line items therein.
 
AD 7.4
This 'department' falls under the purview of my son â whose conduct has become increasingly erratic as of late.
AD 7.5
The payments in question could not be explained by my wife and son, and I, accordingly, cancelled their business bank cards (and my own, for the sake thereof) during June 2025, and requested invoices and proof of expenses from my son for the numerous unexplained expenses.
AD 7.6
Although he provided a few, the majority of the transactions remain unexplained.
AD 7.7
Some of our actual subscriptions, pertaining to, inter alia, internet domains, and the like, were halted due to the card cancellations.
 
AD 7.8
Instead of assisting therewith, my son, unfortunately, adopted a 'superior' position and eﬀectively refused to assist.
AD 7.9
I attach hereto relevant inter-oﬃce communications with my son, conﬁrming all of the above, as annexure "PF7".
AD 7.10
The communications were with his personal assistant for the most part, upon my instructions.
AD 7.11
It is clear that he would or could not provide relevant invoices.
AD 7.12
My son, through the above, inter alia, interfered with the corporations' staﬀ doing their jobs.
 
AD 7.13
Upon the domains and the like being re-instated through payment, our son elected not to provide all employees/staﬀ access to their historic emails and email accounts, but did so on an ad hoc basis, as it suited him.
AD 7.14
This interference has, unfortunately, also continued.
AD 7.15
This conduct is not in the interests of the corporations.
AD 7.16
My wife simply re-approached the banks (being the seventh and eighth respondents) and obtained duplicate/new cards, on or about 24 June 2025.
AD 7.17
I discussed the transactions with her, but she rejected any idea of malfeasance or neglect on our son's part.
 
7.18-7.20 THE R500,000 PAYMENT
AD 7.18
She adopted an 'I will show you' approach, defended our son, and then transferred to him the sum of R500,000.00 from the corporations, on or about 16 July 2025, as a 'birthday gift', which I did not authorise, and which he was not entitled to accept; she has no other sources of income other than her remuneration by the third to sixth respondents.
AD 7.19
This was without my knowledge, and the expense cannot remotely be described as being a legitimate business expense.
AD 7.20
This was separate to his remuneration as director/member.

 
8.	IT EXPENSES ANALYSIS
AD 8.1
In addition to the aforesaid, I annex hereto the IT related expenses (annexure "PF9" hereto) which my son has approved and/or paid over the 2024 to 2025 ﬁnancial year.
AD 8.2
Other than a few, such as Sage (being accounting software), the majority are unexplained, and we have almost no invoices for these items which creates, inter alia, major tax problems.
AD 8.3
The 'expenses' from March 2025, to June 2025, relating to computer related costs solely, are attached hereto marked "PF10".
AD 8.4
The 2024 tax year 'expenses', for this category alone, amount to R6,738,007.47.
 
AD 8.5
The 2025 tax year, thus far, for this category only, amounts to R2,116,159.47.
AD 8.6
These amounts exclude the 'birthday gift', aforesaid, and are almost entirely unexplainable.
AD 8.7
Many of the 'expenses' are also seemingly international.
AD 8.8
Annexed hereto marked "PF11" is a screenshot of a message received from the seventh respondent bank, on or about 05 August 2025, conﬁrming that the business accounts have almost exceeded the yearly allowable quota for funds leaving the Republic of South Africa (I note, in this regard, that the corporations bank together, eﬀectively as a group of companies - their funds are inter alia pooled as necessary).
 
AD 8.9
Not only is this inexplicable, but it will probably cause further, and serious, tax implications for the applicant corporations, to their signiﬁcant detriment.
AD 8.10
For the sake of inter alia the South African Revenue Services, and the Reserve Bank, the corporations will, as it stands, be unable to explain these international expenses.

 
9.	SUBSTANTIAL FINANCIAL MISCONDUCT
AD 9.1
The aforesaid, which appears to constitute substantial ﬁnancial misconduct, is neither sustainable, nor acceptable.
AD 9.2
None of the respondents (third to sixth) are resellers in technology or technological related items, or services.
AD 9.3
Other than a few minor costs for accounting services, internet hosting, and the like, the 'expenses' to which I have referred above, are unrelated to the business of the applicants.
AD 9.4
The aforesaid is entirely due to my son, who is defended, and enabled by my wife, and indicates the misappropriation of substantial sums of money from the corporations aforesaid, to their signiﬁcant detriment.

 
10.	DELINQUENCY AND PROBATION APPLICATION
AD 10.1
I seek, as ﬁnal relief under PART B of the notice of motion, an order declaring the ﬁrst and second respondents delinquent, alternatively placing them under probation.
AD 10.2
I deal therewith at the outset, as their conduct justifying that relief explains the necessity for the relief I seek under PART A.
AD 10.3
My son and wife are, with respect, clearly and evidently acting in a manner which is detrimental to the third to the sixth respondent corporations, and to me, to the extent that their conduct is delinquent alternatively justiﬁes them being placed under probation.
AD 10.4
Their conduct is in clear contravention of the Companies Act, No 71 of 2008, and the Close Corporations Act, No 69 of 1974 (the "Close Corporations Act").
 
AD 10.5
Legal Grounds for Relief
AD 10.5.1
Declaring the ﬁrst and/or second Respondent/s delinquent, as envisaged in Section 162(5) (a)-(c) of the Companies Act, read together at Section 69(8) (a) of the Companies Act, read together with Section 162(5)(f)(ii) thereof, and Section 47 of the Close Corporations Act; alternatively
AD 10.5.2
Placing the ﬁrst and/or second Respondent/s under probation, for which provision is made in Section 162(7)(a)-(c), and Section 162(8) of the Companies Act, taking into account Section 162(5)(f)(ii) thereof, and Section 47 of the Close Corporations Act.
 
AD 10.6
Fiduciary Duties Under Close Corporations Act Section 42 of the Close Corporations Act provides that every member of a close corporation stands in a ﬁduciary relationship [Section 42(1)] with that corporation shall:
AD 10.6.1
Exercise such powers as he may have to manage or represent the corporation in the interest and for the beneﬁt of the corporation; [Section 42 (2)(a)(i)] and
AD 10.6.2
Shall not act without or exceed his powers; [Sec 42(2)(a)(ii)]
AD 10.6.3
Shall avoid any material conﬂict between his own interests and those of the corporation, and in particular shall not derive any personal economic beneﬁt to which he is not entitled by reason of his membership of or service to the corporation, from the corporation or from any other person in circumstances where that beneﬁt is obtained in conﬂict with the interests of the corporation; [Section 42(2)(b)(i)]
 
AD 10.7
Liability for Breach Section 42 provides further that a member of a corporation whose act or omission has breached any duty arising from his ﬁduciary relationship shall be liable to the corporation for â
AD 10.7.1.1
Any loss suﬀered as a result thereof by the corporation; [Section 42 (3)(a)(i)] or
AD 10.7.1.2
any economic beneﬁt derived by the member by reason thereof [Section 42(3)(a) (ii)].
AD 10.8
Disqualiﬁcation Section 47 of the Close Corporations Act recognises that a person removed from an oﬃce of trust on account of misconduct shall be disqualiﬁed from participating in the management of a corporation (save under the authority of a Court).
 
AD 10.9
Grounds for Declaring Delinquency Section 162(5) of the Companies Act provides for the mandatory disqualiﬁcation of a person (by declaring him delinquent) from serving as a director (or close corporation) of a company, and a member of a close corporation [at Section 162 (5)(f)(ii)] under circumstances where a person (such as my wife, and son):
AD 10.9.1
Grossly abused the position of director (or member); [Section 162(5)(c) (i)]
AD 10.9.2
Per Section 162(5)(c)(iii), Intentionally, or by gross negligence, inﬂicted harm upon the company (or close corporation), contrary to Section 76 (2)(a);
 
AD 10.9.3
Acted in a manner:
AD 10.9.3.1
Amounting to gross negligence, wilful misconduct or breach of trust in relation to the performance of the director's (or member's) functions within, and duties to, the company (or close corporation); [Section 76(5)(c)(iv)(aa)]
AD 10.9.3.2
Per Section 162(5)(c)(iv)(bb), acquiesced [per Section 77(3)(b)] in the carrying on of the company's business despite knowing that it was being conducted in a manner prohibited by Section 22(1).
AD 10.9.3.3
Per Section 162(5)(c)(iv)(bb), was a party to an act or omission by the company (or close corporation) [per Section 77(3)(c)] despite knowing that the act or omission was calculated to defraud a creditor, employee or shareholder (or member) of the company (or close corporation), or had another fraudulent purpose.
 
AD 10.10
Grounds for Probation My son and wife have also contravened Section 162(7) of the Companies Act, which provides that a Court may make an order placing a person (director or member) under probation who, while serving as a director:
AD 10.10.1
Acted in a manner that is materially inconsistent with their duties; [Section 162(7)(a) (ii)]
 
AD 10.10.2
Per Section 162(a)(iii):
AD 10.10.2.1
Whose conduct had the result that is oppressive or unfairly prejudicial to, or that unfairly disregards my interests;
AD 10.10.2.2
Carried on the business of the corporation in a manner that is oppressive or unfairly prejudicial to, or that unfairly disregards my interests;
AD 10.10.2.3
Exercised their powers as director/member in a manner that is oppressive or unfairly prejudicial to, or that unfairly disregards my interests.
 
10.11-10.13 Conclusion on Delinquency
AD 10.11
Taking into account the manner in which they have acted, and the above legislation, I am advised that I may seek that an order (as I now do) that the ﬁrst and second respondents be declared delinquent, or be placed under probation.
AD 10.12
The full extent of the transgressions, and the ensuing losses to the third to sixth respondents, have yet to be determined; I request accordingly, inter alia, an order authorising me to appoint necessary experts, including the aforesaid bookkeeper, at the cost of the third to sixth respondents, so that a proper forensic investigation may be conducted.
AD 10.13
At this stage already, signiﬁcant sums of money (as aforesaid) cannot be accounted for.

 
11.	UK OPERATIONS
AD 11.1
I pause to mention that, we also began companies in the United Kingdom, which sell the applicant's products - and which my son has been appointed to direct and manage.
AD 11.2
These companies fall under the UK head oﬃce, being RegimA UK Ltd.
AD 11.3
My wife, my son, and I are the directors thereof.
AD 11.4
While my involvement has been minimal I, inter alia, ensure operational growth, and manage the respondent corporations.
AD 11.5
My son was appointed to oversee the UK branch, which carries under it, as umbrella, RegimA @ Dr H Ltd, RegimA Zone Ltd, RegimA Zone Academy Ltd and RegimA Medic Ltd.
 
AD 11.6
The third to sixth respondents ship to the UK branch, but do not receive payment therefrom due to apparent fraud that transpired in the UK in the past, from which the UK companies allegedly required time to again become ﬁnancially viable.
AD 11.7
This was perpetrated by the then managing director of the UK branch, Isaac Chesno, which resultant in our son's appointment.
AD 11.8
I fear (due to his present conduct) that the continued non-payment (from the UK branch) may inter alia be a ruse.
AD 11.9
I accordingly have no idea pertaining to the ﬁnancial wellness of the UK branches, and intend to approach the relevant Court for relief with regards thereto.

 
12.	NECESSITY OF RELIEF
AD 12.1
