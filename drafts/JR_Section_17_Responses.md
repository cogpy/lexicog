**Prepared by:** Manus AI  
**Date:** November 2, 2025  
**Focus:** Material Non-Disclosures Strategy

## AD 17.1

**Applicant's Allegation (AD 17.1):**
> "This application is lodged ex parte as I fear, with good reason, that the first and/or second respondents will react to the service of this application upon them by misappropriating further sums of money from the aforesaid corporations (as a "knee jerk reaction" thereto), due to the first respondent having immediately and defiantly transferred the sum of R500,000.00 to the second respondent, shortly after I took their cards, as aforesaid, and questioned the transactions."

**JR 17.1 (Draft Response):**

I deny the Applicant’s allegation and state that his purported “fear” is neither reasonable nor well-founded. It is, in fact, a self-serving and misleading justification for bringing this application on an ex parte basis, predicated on a significant material non-disclosure.

1.  The transfer of R500,000.00 was not a “defiant” act of misappropriation. It was a necessary and urgent operational payment made to the Second Respondent to cover immediate business expenses and creditor payments for the e-commerce operation that generates R34.9 million in annual revenue. This transfer was made necessary precisely because the Applicant, in his own “knee jerk reaction,” had unilaterally and without warning cancelled 15 business credit cards on 7 June 2025, thereby crippling the companies’ ability to meet their financial obligations.

2.  The Applicant materially misleads this Honourable Court by omitting the critical context: his fear of a “knee jerk reaction” is a projection of his own conduct. The Second Respondent provided the Applicant’s accountant and fellow Trustee, Mr. Danie Bantjies, with comprehensive reports detailing financial misconduct on 6 June 2025. The very next day, the Applicant retaliated by cancelling the credit cards, manufacturing the very crisis he now uses to justify urgency.

3.  The Applicant’s fear is therefore not based on any conduct of the Respondents, but on a situation he deliberately engineered. This is a classic application of the doctrine of *venire contra factum proprium*—the Applicant cannot be allowed to benefit from a predicament of his own making.

## AD 17.2

**Applicant's Allegation (AD 17.2):**
> "This application serves also (to an extent) the purpose of an anton piller application in that I - having reason to believe that the first and second respondents will conceal or destroy relevant documentation if they are not subject to an appropriate order - request an order that they surrender, forthwith, all documentation (electronic and otherwise) within their possession relating to the administration (financial and otherwise) of the third to sixth respondents, and all login details and passwords to any banking and other online facilities relating thereto."

**JR 17.2 (Draft Response):**

I deny in the strongest terms that the Respondents have any intention of concealing or destroying documentation. The Applicant’s alleged “reason to believe” is baseless and constitutes another material non-disclosure to this Honourable Court.

1.  The Applicant’s claim is directly contradicted by the facts. On 6 June 2025, the Second Respondent, acting with full transparency, provided the Applicant’s own accountant, Mr. Bantjies, with comprehensive financial reports, analyses, and supporting evidence. This act is the very antithesis of concealing or destroying documentation.

2.  The Applicant fails to disclose to this Court that the Respondents have been the party providing information, while the Applicant and his associates have been the party obfuscating it. The request for an Anton Piller-style order is not a measure to preserve evidence, but a punitive and tactical maneuver designed to harass the Respondents and seize control of the business operations under a false pretext.

3.  The Respondents have at all times acted to preserve the integrity of the companies’ financial records, as it is this very evidence that exposes the misconduct which the Applicant now seeks to conceal through this urgent application.

## AD 17.3

**Applicant's Allegation (AD 17.3):**
> "Such applications are usually brought, with respect, on an ex parte basis, for obvious reasons."

**JR 17.3 (Draft Response):**

While we acknowledge the legal principle that certain applications may be brought ex parte, the Applicant’s reliance on this principle is misplaced and abusive in these circumstances. An applicant approaching the court on an ex parte basis is held to the highest standard of good faith (*uberrima fides*), a duty the Applicant has manifestly failed to discharge.

1.  The Applicant has approached this Court with unclean hands, having concealed a series of material facts, any one of which should have been sufficient to persuade the Court not to grant relief without notice to the Respondents. These non-disclosures include:
    a.  **Mr. Bantjies’s Triple Conflict of Interest:** The Applicant failed to disclose that his confirmatory witness, Mr. Bantjies, is not an independent accountant but is simultaneously: (i) a co-Trustee of the Faucitt Family Trust, (ii) a significant debtor to the Applicant (to the sum of R18.685 million), and (iii) the accountant for the very entities he was supposedly investigating. Furthermore, Mr. Bantjies acted as the Commissioner of Oaths for the Applicant’s own affidavit, a shocking breach of legal and ethical standards.
    b.  **The True Timeline of Events:** The Applicant concealed that the alleged “discovery” of irregularities in July was false. The Second Respondent had already reported the misconduct to Mr. Bantjies on 6 June 2025, and the Applicant’s subsequent card cancellations on 7 June 2025 were a direct, retaliatory response.
    c.  **The Self-Created Urgency:** The Applicant failed to disclose that the entire basis for urgency was a direct consequence of his own actions in sabotaging the companies’ financial operations.

2.  The “obvious reasons” for an ex parte application do not apply when the applicant’s case is built on a foundation of misrepresentation and material non-disclosure. The Applicant is not protecting the companies from the Respondents; he is protecting himself from the evidence the Respondents have compiled.

## AD 17.4

**Applicant's Allegation (AD 17.4):**
> "In the premises we say that the matter is sufficiently urgent to compel the attention of the above Honourable Court ex parte, on an urgent basis."

**JR 17.4 (Draft Response):**

I deny that the matter is urgent, and I specifically deny that there was any legitimate basis for it to be heard ex parte. The entire premise of urgency is a fabrication constructed by the Applicant to mislead this Honourable Court.

1.  The urgency was self-created. Any disruption to the business operations of the Third to Sixth Respondents was the direct and foreseeable result of the Applicant’s decision to cancel the business credit cards on 7 June 2025. This act of sabotage, undertaken a single day after receiving detailed reports of financial misconduct, was the sole cause of the subsequent operational difficulties.

2.  The Applicant’s true motive was not to prevent financial harm, but to launch a pre-emptive strike against the Respondents to prevent them from taking further action based on the fraud they had uncovered. This application is not a shield to protect the companies, but a sword to attack the whistleblowers.

3.  Therefore, the ex parte order was obtained through a gross abuse of the process of this Court, founded on material non-disclosures and a false narrative of urgency. We respectfully submit that the order must be set aside on this basis alone.
