# DRAFT: DR Responses for Section 17 (Ex Parte Basis)

**Prepared by:** Manus AI  
**Date:** November 2, 2025  
**Focus:** Complementary Evidence and Factual Corroboration

---

## AD 17.1

**Applicant's Allegation (AD 17.1):**
> "This application is lodged ex parte as I fear, with good reason, that the first and/or second respondents will react to the service of this application upon them by misappropriating further sums of money from the aforesaid corporations (as a "knee jerk reaction" thereto), due to the first respondent having immediately and defiantly transferred the sum of R500,000.00 to the second respondent, shortly after I took their cards, as aforesaid, and questioned the transactions."

**DR 17.1 (Draft Response):**

I confirm the contents of JR 17.1 and add the following facts. The Applicant’s stated “fear” is disingenuous and is contradicted by the objective evidence.

1.  The R500,000.00 transfer was not a “misappropriation” but a critical operational payment required to maintain business continuity. On 7 June 2025, the Applicant cancelled 15 business credit cards (**Annexure DF4**), which were essential for paying international suppliers, software subscriptions, and hosting for the 51 e-commerce stores that generate R34.9 million in annual revenue. The transfer was a desperate measure to cover these immediate, legitimate, and verifiable business expenses.

2.  The Applicant’s claim of a “knee jerk reaction” is a deliberate inversion of the truth. I personally delivered comprehensive financial reports to his accountant, Mr. Bantjies, on **6 June 2025**. The Applicant’s cancellation of all credit cards occurred the very next day, on **7 June 2025**. This timeline establishes that the Applicant’s action was the actual “knee jerk reaction” to the exposure of the financial misconduct detailed in my reports.

3.  The Applicant’s fear is therefore not based on any rational assessment of risk, but is a self-serving narrative designed to conceal his own retaliatory conduct and to mislead this Honourable Court as to the true cause of the operational crisis.

## AD 17.2

**Applicant's Allegation (AD 17.2):**
> "This application serves also (to an extent) the purpose of an anton piller application in that I - having reason to believe that the first and second respondents will conceal or destroy relevant documentation if they are not subject to an appropriate order..."

**DR 17.2 (Draft Response):**

I confirm the contents of JR 17.2. The Applicant’s assertion that he has “reason to believe” we would conceal or destroy documentation is a baseless and malicious falsehood.

1.  My actions prove the opposite. I am the one who compiled, preserved, and presented evidence of financial misconduct. On **6 June 2025**, I provided Mr. Bantjies with detailed reports, spreadsheets, and supporting documents. I have meticulously archived all financial data, communications, and system logs. My conduct has been one of total transparency and a commitment to preserving the evidentiary record.

2.  The request for an Anton Piller-type order is not a protective measure, but a hostile tactic. The true purpose is to seize the very evidence that I have compiled against the Applicant and his associates, and to disrupt my ability to continue managing the business and uncovering further misconduct. It is a transparent attempt to turn the tables on the whistleblower.

3.  I have a vested interest in the preservation of all documentation, as it is this documentation that will ultimately vindicate me and expose the truth. The Applicant’s claim is devoid of any factual foundation and should be dismissed as the tactical maneuver that it is.

## AD 17.3

**Applicant's Allegation (AD 17.3):**
> "Such applications are usually brought, with respect, on an ex parte basis, for obvious reasons."

**DR 17.3 (Draft Response):**

I confirm the contents of JR 17.3 and wish to underscore the extent of the material non-disclosures upon which this ex parte application was founded.

1.  The Applicant failed to disclose to this Honourable Court that his key witness, Mr. Danie Bantjies, who provided a confirmatory affidavit, is hopelessly conflicted. The Applicant did not disclose that:
    a.  Mr. Bantjies is a co-Trustee of the Faucitt Family Trust alongside the Applicant.
    b.  Mr. Bantjies is a significant personal debtor to the Applicant, owing him R18.685 million as per **Annexure SF1**.
    c.  Mr. Bantjies was the Commissioner of Oaths for the Applicant’s founding affidavit, a fundamental breach of the requirement for an independent commissioner.

2.  The Applicant presented a false timeline to the Court. He failed to disclose that he was in possession of my detailed financial reports from **6 June 2025**, and that his cancellation of the credit cards on **7 June 2025** was a direct response to those reports. He created a false impression of a recent discovery of wrongdoing in July to manufacture a sense of urgency.

3.  These are not minor omissions; they are profound misrepresentations that go to the very heart of the matter. The Applicant has fundamentally breached his duty of *uberrima fides* to this Court, and the ex parte order was granted on the basis of a deliberately incomplete and misleading set of facts.

## AD 17.4

**Applicant's Allegation (AD 17.4):**
> "In the premises we say that the matter is sufficiently urgent to compel the attention of the above Honourable Court ex parte, on an urgent basis."

**DR 17.4 (Draft Response):**

I confirm the contents of JR 17.4. The claim of urgency is a fabrication, and the evidence demonstrates that the crisis was entirely self-created by the Applicant.

1.  There was no operational urgency prior to 7 June 2025. The e-commerce businesses were functioning and profitable, generating R34.9 million in annual revenue under my management.

2.  The urgency arose as a direct and immediate consequence of the Applicant’s decision to cancel 15 business credit cards on 7 June 2025. This single act crippled the companies’ ability to pay for essential services, including web hosting, software subscriptions, and international suppliers. The resulting disruption was not only foreseeable but, I submit, intended.

3.  The timeline is irrefutable: I delivered reports exposing misconduct on **June 6th**. The Applicant retaliated by sabotaging the company’s financial infrastructure on **June 7th**. He then approached the Court citing the very chaos he had engineered as the basis for urgent relief. This is a flagrant abuse of the court process.

4.  The matter was not urgent in the legal sense, as the Applicant had ample opportunity to address his purported concerns through ordinary legal channels. He chose not to do so, instead opting for a manufactured crisis to justify an ex parte application designed to dispossess the Respondents of control and evidence. The ex parte order, having been obtained on this false premise, must be discharged.
