## RE: THE APPLICANT'S OMISSIONS REGARDING THE TRUE GENESIS OF THE DISPUTE

### The Pattern of Retaliation Following the May 15, 2025 Confrontation

**JR 10.9** The Applicant’s founding affidavit omits the true genesis of the dispute, which was not mismanagement on my part, but rather a direct and systematic retaliation that commenced immediately after I fulfilled my fiduciary duty as a trustee.

**JR 10.9.1** On May 15, 2025, I confronted Ms. Rynette Farrar regarding a long-outstanding debt of R1,035,000 owed by RegimA Skin Treatments to the estate of the Second Respondent’s late fiancée, Kayla Pretorius (Annexure **SF6**). I informed Ms. Farrar that withholding these funds, which were part of a deceased estate, was tantamount to profiting from the proceeds of murder. Ms. Farrar had previously falsely claimed to me that this amount had been paid.

**JR 10.9.2** A clear pattern of retaliatory action emerged immediately following my inquiry. These actions were not random; they were sequential, targeted, and designed to systematically dismantle the profitable business operations managed by the Second Respondent and myself.

**JR 10.9.3** **First Retaliatory Act (7 Days):** On May 22, 2025, a mere seven days after my confrontation with Ms. Farrar, the Shopify audit trail for our e-commerce stores became unavailable, and orders were removed (Annexure **JF9**). This action immediately crippled our ability to manage the R34.9 million e-commerce business and track sales revenue.

**JR 10.9.4** **Second Retaliatory Act (14 Days):** On May 29, 2025, just fourteen days after my inquiry, a competing domain, `regimaskin.co.za`, was registered by Adderory (Pty) Ltd (Annexure **JF4**). As established, Adderory is owned by Ms. Farrar’s son. This was a calculated move to create a vehicle for diverting our customers and revenue.

**JR 10.9.5** **Third Retaliatory Act (36 Days):** On June 20, 2025, the plan was put into action. An email was sent to the RegimA customer database instructing them to cease using our official `regima.zone` domain and to use the newly created `regimaskin.co.za` domain instead (Annexure **JF8**). This constituted a direct hijacking of our customer base, diverting them to a competing entity controlled by Ms. Farrar’s family.

**JR 10.9.6** This sequence of events, which the Applicant fails to disclose, reveals the true nature of the dispute. It was not born of any misconduct on my part, but from a coordinated effort to punish me for fulfilling my duty as a trustee and to seize control of the revenue streams I and the Second Respondent had built. The Applicant’s entire narrative of urgency and mismanagement is a smokescreen to conceal this systematic sabotage.

## ANALYSIS: GRADUAL REVELATION STRATEGY (LAYER 4)

### Layer 4: The Pattern Emerges

This section moves beyond revealing inconsistencies (Layer 2) and control structures (Layer 3) to explicitly establishing a pattern of cause and effect. The narrative demonstrates that a specific action (Jacqui's inquiry) triggered a specific, sequential, and hostile reaction.

**1. Establishing the Trigger Event (JR 10.9.1):**
The affidavit anchors the entire sequence to a single, morally charged event: the May 15, 2025 confrontation over the R1,035,000 debt owed to a deceased partner's estate. The inclusion of the phrase 
"profiting from the proceeds of murder" immediately establishes the high ethical stakes and provides a powerful motive for the subsequent retaliation.

**2. Creating a Causal Chain (JR 10.9.3 - 10.9.5):**
The affidavit presents a clear, undeniable timeline:
   - **Day 0 (May 15):** Jacqui confronts Rynette.
   - **Day +7 (May 22):** E-commerce data is crippled.
   - **Day +14 (May 29):** A competing domain is registered by Rynette’s son.
   - **Day +36 (June 20):** Customers are diverted to the new domain.

By explicitly stating the time elapsed for each event ("a mere seven days," "just fourteen days"), the narrative creates a powerful inference of causality. It transforms a series of isolated incidents into a coherent, calculated strategy of retaliation.

**3. Exposing the Smokescreen (JR 10.9.6):**
The section concludes by explicitly stating that the Applicant’s narrative is a “smokescreen.” Having laid out the evidence of the retaliation pattern, this conclusion feels earned and logical rather than like an unsupported accusation. It reframes the entire dispute: the issue is not mismanagement, but punishment for fulfilling a trustee’s duty.

### Narrative Technique

- **Temporal Proximity:** The core technique of Layer 4 is using the closeness in time between events to imply a causal link. The draft repeatedly emphasizes the short timeframes to make the connection between the confrontation and the retaliation undeniable.
- **Escalating Actions:** The pattern shows a clear escalation: from crippling data access, to creating a competing entity, to actively diverting customers. This demonstrates a deliberate and escalating campaign.
- **Connecting to the Control Structure:** This section builds directly on Layer 3. The reader already knows that Rynette controls the systems and that Adderory is her son’s company. Therefore, when the retaliation involves actions taken by these entities, the reader immediately understands who is behind it.

### Evidence Web

This section relies on a tight, chronological set of annexures:

| Annexure | Content | Significance |
|----------|---------|--------------|
| **SF6** | Kayla Pretorius estate documentation | Establishes the R1,035,000 debt and the basis for the confrontation. |
| **JF9** | Shopify data showing order removal | Provides hard evidence of the first retaliatory act on May 22, 2025. |
| **JF4** | Domain registration for `regimaskin.co.za` | Proves Rynette’s son registered the competing domain on May 29, 2025. |
| **JF8** | Email from Ms. Gee re: domain diversion | Confirms the instruction to divert customers on June 20, 2025. |

### Cognitive Synergy

This section creates powerful synergy with the Second Respondent’s affidavit:

- **Jacqui’s Affidavit (This Section):** Details the retaliation that followed her inquiry into the debt owed to Kayla’s estate.
- **Daniel’s Affidavit (Complementary):** Details the retaliation that followed his submission of the fraud report to Mr. Bantjies on June 6, 2025.

When read together, the two affidavits will demonstrate a clear and repeated pattern: any attempt by a beneficiary to investigate or expose financial irregularities is met with immediate, severe, and systematic sabotage by the Applicant and his associates.

### Connection to Integrated Narrative Framework

This section is the core of **Act II: Discovery and Confrontation** and **Act III: Systematic Retaliation**. It provides the narrative engine for the entire case, explaining *why* the sabotage began. It directly links the Applicant’s and his associates’ actions to a clear motive: silencing a trustee who was asking inconvenient questions about a significant unpaid debt.

## SUMMARY OF SECTION 6

### Core Narrative Achievement

This section successfully applies **Layer 4: The Pattern Emerges** by establishing a clear causal chain between Jacqui's May 15, 2025 confrontation and three sequential retaliatory acts that followed within 36 days.

### The Retaliation Timeline

| Date | Days After Confrontation | Event | Evidence |
|------|-------------------------|-------|----------|
| **May 15, 2025** | Day 0 | Jacqui confronts Rynette about R1,035,000 debt to Kayla's estate | Annexure SF6 |
| **May 22, 2025** | Day +7 | Shopify audit trail unavailable, orders removed | Annexure JF9 |
| **May 29, 2025** | Day +14 | Domain regimaskin.co.za registered by Adderory (Rynette's son) | Annexure JF4 |
| **June 20, 2025** | Day +36 | Email sent diverting customers to new domain | Annexure JF8 |

### Narrative Structure

**JR 10.9:** Establishes that the Applicant's affidavit omits the true genesis of the dispute

**JR 10.9.1:** Introduces the trigger event - May 15 confrontation about unpaid debt to deceased partner's estate

**JR 10.9.2:** States that a clear pattern of retaliatory action emerged immediately

**JR 10.9.3:** First retaliatory act (7 days) - E-commerce data crippled

**JR 10.9.4:** Second retaliatory act (14 days) - Competing domain registered by Rynette's son

**JR 10.9.5:** Third retaliatory act (36 days) - Customers diverted to competing domain

**JR 10.9.6:** Concludes that the Applicant's narrative is a "smokescreen" to conceal systematic sabotage

### Evidence Support

All assertions supported by 4 critical annexures that form a chronological evidence chain:
- **SF6:** Kayla Pretorius estate documentation (R1,035,000 debt)
- **JF9:** Shopify data showing order removal (May 22, 2025)
- **JF4:** Domain registration records (regimaskin.co.za, May 29, 2025)
- **JF8:** Email from Ms. Gee re domain diversion (June 20, 2025)

### Key Revelations

**1. The Trigger Was Ethical, Not Financial:**
The confrontation was about honoring a deceased partner's estate, not about business operations. This establishes Jacqui as fulfilling her fiduciary duty as a trustee.

**2. The Retaliation Was Immediate and Sequential:**
The temporal proximity (7 days, 14 days, 36 days) creates an undeniable inference of causality. These were not random events but a coordinated campaign.

**3. The Retaliation Involved Related Parties:**
The domain was registered by Adderory (Rynette's son), connecting back to the control structure revealed in Layer 3. The reader now understands that the network identified earlier was actively working to punish Jacqui.

**4. The Retaliation Was Designed to Destroy Revenue:**
The sequence shows escalation: cripple data → create competing entity → divert customers. This was not defensive action but offensive sabotage designed to seize control of the R34.9M e-commerce operations.

### Cognitive Synergy with Daniel's Affidavit

This section creates a powerful parallel structure:

**Jacqui's Timeline (This Section):**
- **May 15:** Confronts Rynette about unpaid debt
- **May 22 (+7 days):** Data crippled
- **May 29 (+14 days):** Competing domain registered
- **June 20 (+36 days):** Customers diverted

**Daniel's Timeline (Complementary - to be detailed in his affidavit):**
- **June 6:** Submits fraud report to Bantjies
- **June 7 (+1 day):** All cards cancelled
- **June 10 (+4 days):** Audit request dismissed by Bantjies
- **July 8:** Warehouse operations stopped
- **September 11:** Accounts emptied

**Together They Reveal:**
Both beneficiaries who attempted to investigate or expose financial irregularities were met with immediate, severe, and systematic retaliation. The pattern is unmistakable: investigate fraud → immediate sabotage.

### Connection to Previous Sections

**Section 4 (Layer 1-2: Surface Claims & Timeline Contradictions):**
- Established the 67-day delay contradicting urgency
- Introduced the one-day card cancellation after Daniel's report
- Set up the timeline framework

**Section 5 (Layer 3: Control Structure & Financial Connections):**
- Revealed Bantjies's triple conflict (Trustee + Accountant + R18.685M Debtor)
- Exposed the network (Bantjies-Rynette-Linda-Adderory)
- Introduced the May 15 confrontation and unpaid debt

**Section 6 (Layer 4: The Pattern Emerges):**
- Completes the retaliation timeline from Jacqui's perspective
- Shows the immediate, sequential, escalating response
- Establishes causality through temporal proximity
- Reframes the entire dispute as punishment, not protection

### Tone and Style Maintained

**Professional Elegance:**
- Formal legal language appropriate for court
- Clear, structured presentation of chronological events
- Logical progression from trigger to conclusion

**Neutral Presentation:**
- Facts stated objectively with precise dates
- Temporal proximity emphasized without hyperbole
- "Smokescreen" conclusion feels earned, not accusatory
- Inference of causality created through evidence, not assertion

**Material Evidence Support:**
- Every event supported by annexure reference
- Specific dates and timeframes cited
- Documentary evidence for each retaliatory act
- Chronological evidence chain

### Foreshadowing Layer 5

This section sets up the next layer of revelation by:

1. Establishing the pattern of immediate retaliation after investigating fraud
2. Connecting the retaliation to the control structure (Rynette-Adderory)
3. Demonstrating the systematic nature of the sabotage
4. Showing the escalation from data destruction to customer diversion

The next section will complete Layer 5 by revealing the final truth: this was not a dispute about mismanagement, but a coordinated effort by co-trustees (Peter and Bantjies) to punish beneficiaries (Jacqui and Daniel) for exposing systematic fraud, using the trust, companies, banks, and courts as weapons.

## DRAFT NOTES

**Strengths:**
- Professional, neutral tone maintained throughout
- Powerful causal chain established through temporal proximity
- Evidence-based assertions with comprehensive annexure references
- Gradual revelation technique properly applied (Layer 4)
- Creates strong synergy with Daniel's complementary affidavit
- Ethical dimension (deceased partner's estate) adds moral weight
- Clear escalation pattern (cripple → create → divert)
- Reframes entire dispute as punishment for fulfilling trustee duty

**Areas for Further Development:**
- The connection to the August 11 "Main Trustee" document deception should be developed in the next section
- The final act of retaliation (August 13 interdict, 2 days after document signing) should be detailed
- The parallel with Daniel's timeline should be explicitly stated in a later section that brings both narratives together
- Additional context about Kayla's murder (July 13, 2023) and the significance of the unpaid debt could strengthen the ethical dimension

**Integration with Existing Sections:**

✓ **Section 4:** Established timeline contradictions and introduced card cancellation timing  
✓ **Section 5:** Revealed control structure and introduced May 15 confrontation  
✓ **Section 6:** Completed the retaliation timeline and established causal pattern  
⚬ **Section 7 (Next):** Should reveal the final deception (August 11 document) and punishment (August 13 interdict)

**Coherence Check:**
✓ Maintains First Respondent's perspective
✓ Supports all claims with material evidence
✓ Creates synergy with Second Respondent's affidavit
✓ Follows gradual revelation strategy
✓ Builds upon previous sections' foundations
✓ Sets up final revelation in subsequent sections
✓ Professional tone suitable for court
✓ Evidence-based, not accusatory

**Next Section Preview:**

Section 7 should introduce **Layer 5: The Truth Revealed** by:
- Detailing the August 11, 2025 deception into signing "Main Trustee" document
- Documenting the August 13, 2025 interdict as punishment (2 days later)
- Connecting Peter's absolute powers within the trust to the abuse of process
- Revealing that Peter could have resolved everything internally but chose litigation
- Establishing that the ex parte application contained material non-disclosures
- Showing that Bantjies certified the affidavit despite being undisclosed trustee and debtor
- Completing the narrative: co-trustees weaponized trust, companies, banks, and courts against beneficiaries who exposed fraud
