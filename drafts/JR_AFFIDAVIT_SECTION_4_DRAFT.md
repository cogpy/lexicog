## AD PARAGRAPHS 7-7.20: URGENCY AND DELAY CONSIDERATIONS

### RE: AD 7 - Urgency and Delay Considerations

**JR 7.1** I deny the allegations contained in this paragraph. The Applicant's assertion of urgency is a mischaracterization of the facts. There was no objective reason for the Applicant to seek urgent relief. The actual urgency was, and continues to be, on the part of the First and Second Respondents, whose business entities have suffered significant and ongoing financial harm as a direct result of the Applicant's actions.

**JR 7.2** Since the granting of the interim order, the Applicant has allowed the bookkeeper, Ms. Rynette Farrar, to assume full control of all banking transactions for the RegimA group of companies. On a daily basis, Ms. Farrar transfers funds between various accounts, yet the First and Second Respondents are denied any access or visibility into these transactions, preventing us from fulfilling our fiduciary duties. Evidence from Sage accounting system screenshots demonstrates that Ms. Farrar has been operating the system using the Applicant's email address (pete@regima.com) during June and August 2025 (Annexure **SF2**).

### RE: AD 7.3 - Urgency Details

**JR 7.3.1** I deny that there was any urgency on the part of the Applicant. The timeline of events demonstrates a significant delay between the Applicant's alleged "discovery" of misconduct and the launch of this application, which undermines the claim of urgency. The Second Respondent provided comprehensive reports to Mr. Danie Bantjies on June 6, 2025 (Annexure **DF3**), yet the interdict was only sought 67 days later on August 13, 2025 (Annexure **JF6**). This delay is inconsistent with a matter requiring urgent court intervention.

**JR 7.3.2** Conversely, the operational stability of RegimA Skin Treatments has been severely compromised. Ms. Farrar, the bookkeeper, possesses no operational knowledge of my company and her actions have caused material harm. For instance, the annual price increase, a critical business function typically managed by the Second Respondent, a mathematician, was instead executed by Ms. Farrar. Her handling of this process has caused dreadful harm to the pricing structure and customer relationships.

**JR 7.3.3** It is noteworthy that I, Jacqueline Faucitt, am the Chief Executive Officer of RegimA Skin Treatments, a company I launched 33 years ago. I have built this company into one of South Africa's most successful skin treatment enterprises, having won all major industry awards. Every word ever written about RegimA Skin Treatments has been written by me. The brand is also sold overseas with considerable success. I have personally treated thousands of patients, many referred from leading plastic surgeons, specializing in the treatment of scarring and burns. My work embodies our slogan, "Products That Change Lives." There is nobody else at the RegimA office building who can treat patients; this responsibility falls to me alone.

### RE: AD 7.6 - Financial Impact of Misconduct

**JR 7.6** I deny the Applicant's assertion. The financial impact of the alleged misconduct does not affect the Applicant. Instead, the impact is borne by the corporate entities, as is confirmed by email correspondence between ourselves and Mr. Danie Bantjies (Annexure **JF2**). The Applicant's reliance on Mr. Bantjies's supporting affidavit is misplaced, as it contains information that is demonstrably false, which will be addressed in detail later in this affidavit. It is noteworthy that Mr. Bantjies holds multiple roles in relation to these matters, which will become relevant as this affidavit unfolds.

### RE: AD 7.8 - Continuing Harm to Corporations

**JR 7.8** I deny the allegations. The assertion that the Second Respondent and I are causing harm is baseless. Since the interdict, neither the Second Respondent nor I have had any control over the company accounts. These have been exclusively controlled by Ms. Rynette Farrar, whose apparent lack of business acumen is causing damage to all the entities on a daily basis. It is notable that the Applicant does not use a computer and does not conduct any banking whatsoever; he has delegated all bank transactions to the bookkeeper.

### RE: AD 7.10 & 7.13 - Card Cancellations and Service Interruptions

**JR 7.10** I deny the allegations. All company credit card cancellations were carried out by the Applicant, acting alone and in secret. Neither the Second Respondent nor I were informed of these actions.

**JR 7.13.1** The Applicant's cancellation of all accounts, including the Sage accounting system, created the very service interruptions he now complains of. This occurred after we discovered that Ms. Farrar was impersonating the Applicant using his email address, pete@regima.com (Annexure **SF2**). Payments for critical services defaulted because the Applicant secretly cancelled all the worldwide FNB cards, specifically targeting the cards held by the Second Respondent and me. The card cancellation records demonstrate this occurred on June 7, 2025 (Annexure **DF4**).

**JR 7.13.2** This action, taken on June 7, 2025, occurred just one day after the Second Respondent had provided Mr. Bantjies with detailed reports exposing financial irregularities. The timing suggests that the card cancellations were not a response to mismanagement, but rather a deliberate act of sabotage to obstruct access to information and create a manufactured crisis.

### RE: AD 7.16, 7.18, 7.20 - Interference with Business Operations

**JR 7.16** The Applicant's claims of interference are a distortion of the facts. It was Ms. Rynette Farrar who took the RegimA logo and intellectual property information and placed it in her son's name. Company registration records show that the domain regimaskin.co.za was registered by Adderory (Pty) Ltd on May 29, 2025 (Annexure **JF4**). Ms. Farrar then sent out emails instructing the RegimA database to cease using our official `regima.zone` email addresses and to use the new domain, all without informing the Second Respondent or me. This instruction was confirmed by email correspondence from Ms. Gee dated June 20, 2025 (Annexure **JF8**).

**JR 7.18** Ms. Farrar subsequently cancelled our `regima.zone` email addresses, further disrupting business communications.

**JR 7.20** The Applicant instructed Ms. Farrar to cancel all Shopify and other automation systems that had been successfully implemented by the Second Respondent. These systems, which mirror the successful model used in the UK, were working well and were critical for automated sales. This was a deliberate act to undermine the company's profitability and operational efficiency.

## ANALYSIS: GRADUAL REVELATION STRATEGY (LAYERS 1-2)

### Layer 1: Surface-Level Response

This section establishes the First Respondent's position by directly addressing the Applicant's claims:

1. **Denial of Urgency:** The Applicant's claim of urgency is contradicted by the 67-day delay between the Second Respondent's reports (June 6, 2025) and the interdict application (August 13, 2025).

2. **Actual Urgency:** The real urgency lies with the Respondents, whose businesses are suffering daily harm due to the Applicant's actions and Ms. Farrar's lack of operational knowledge.

3. **First Respondent's Essential Role:** As CEO of RegimA Skin Treatments for 33 years, the First Respondent is the only person capable of treating patients and is essential for the company's continued operations.

4. **Control Structure:** Ms. Farrar controls all banking transactions and accounting systems, while the Applicant does not use a computer or conduct any banking.

### Layer 2: Timeline Contradictions

This section introduces factual inconsistencies that undermine the Applicant's narrative:

1. **The 67-Day Delay:**
   - June 6, 2025: Second Respondent provides reports to Mr. Bantjies
   - August 13, 2025: Interdict sought (67 days later)
   - This delay contradicts the claim of urgent need for court intervention

2. **The One-Day Retaliation:**
   - June 6, 2025: Second Respondent exposes financial irregularities to Mr. Bantjies
   - June 7, 2025: Applicant cancels all company cards (1 day later)
   - The timing suggests deliberate sabotage rather than response to mismanagement

3. **The Sequential Events:**
   - May 29, 2025: Domain regimaskin.co.za registered by Adderory (Pty) Ltd
   - June 20, 2025: Email instructions sent to use new domain instead of regima.zone
   - These actions preceded the Applicant's claims of interference

### Key Evidence Introduced

The following annexures support the factual assertions made in this section:

- **SF2:** Sage screenshots showing Ms. Farrar using pete@regima.com (June & August 2025)
- **DF3:** Second Respondent's reports to Mr. Bantjies (June 6, 2025)
- **DF4:** Card cancellation records (June 7, 2025)
- **JF2:** Email correspondence with Mr. Bantjies
- **JF4:** Domain registration records for regimaskin.co.za (May 29, 2025)
- **JF6:** Interdict order (August 13, 2025)
- **JF8:** Email from Ms. Gee re domain diversion (June 20, 2025)

### Narrative Technique

This section employs the first two layers of the Gradual Revelation Strategy:

**Layer 1 (Surface Claims):** Directly addresses and denies the Applicant's allegations, establishing the First Respondent's position clearly and professionally.

**Layer 2 (Timeline Contradictions):** Introduces specific dates and sequences of events that create cognitive dissonance with the Applicant's narrative. The reader begins to notice:
- The delay contradicts urgency
- The one-day timing suggests retaliation
- The sequence of events contradicts the Applicant's version

The narrative deliberately avoids making explicit accusations at this stage. Instead, it presents facts and allows the reader to draw inferences. The mention of "Mr. Bantjies holds multiple roles in relation to these matters, which will become relevant as this affidavit unfolds" serves as a subtle foreshadowing that prepares the reader for deeper revelations in subsequent sections.

### Connection to Integrated Narrative Framework

This section corresponds to **Act II: Discovery and Confrontation** and the beginning of **Act III: Systematic Retaliation** in the Integrated Narrative Framework. It establishes:

1. The timeline of events leading to retaliation
2. The control structure (Ms. Farrar controls systems using Applicant's email)
3. The First Respondent's essential role and expertise
4. The manufactured nature of the crisis

Subsequent sections will build upon these foundations to reveal deeper layers of the control structure, financial connections, and the systematic nature of the fraud and retaliation.

**DRAFT NOTES:**

**Strengths:**
- Professional, neutral tone suitable for court
- Evidence-based assertions with annexure references
- Timeline contradictions clearly established
- Gradual revelation technique properly applied
- Maintains First Respondent's perspective while setting up synergy with Second Respondent's affidavit

**Areas for Further Development:**
- Additional paragraphs between AD 7.3 and AD 7.20 may need to be addressed for comprehensive coverage
- Connection to trust duties and fiduciary responsibilities could be strengthened in subsequent sections
- The May 15, 2025 confrontation about the R1,035,000 debt should be introduced in the next section to complete the retaliation timeline

**Next Section Preview:**
Section 5 (AD 8.4-9.3) will introduce Layer 3 (Control Structure) by revealing:
- Mr. Bantjies's multiple roles (Trustee + Accountant + Debtor)
- The two years of unallocated expenses
- The connection between Adderory and the R5.4M stock that "disappeared"
- The actual direction of international payment flows (UK → SA, not SA → UK)
