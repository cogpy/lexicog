## AD PARAGRAPHS 8.4-9.3: FINANCIAL DISCREPANCIES AND MISCONDUCT

### RE: AD 8.4 - Discovery of Financial Discrepancies

**JR 8.4** I deny the allegations. The Applicant’s narrative regarding the “discovery” of financial discrepancies is misleading and omits critical context. The accountant who allegedly made this discovery, Mr. Danie Bantjies, was not an impartial actor. At the time of this purported discovery, Mr. Bantjies held three conflicting roles: he was the accountant for the RegimA group, an undisclosed trustee of the Faucitt Family Trust, and a debtor to the same trust for an amount of R18.685 million (Annexure **SF1**). Furthermore, this “discovery” occurred only after the Second Respondent had submitted a detailed report to Mr. Bantjies on June 6, 2025, exposing the very financial irregularities the Applicant now claims to have recently found (Annexure **DF3**). Mr. Bantjies subsequently dismissed the Second Respondent’s request for a forensic audit on June 10, 2025.

### RE: AD 8.5 - Accountant's Attendance and Findings

**JR 8.5** I deny the allegations. The Applicant’s reliance on Mr. Bantjies’s findings is misplaced. The two years of unallocated expenses, which were suddenly “dumped” into the RegimA Worldwide Distribution entity on March 30, 2025, occurred under Mr. Bantjies’s watch as the group’s accountant. During this period, the accounting system was controlled by Ms. Rynette Farrar, who operated it using the Applicant’s email address (Annexure **SF2**). It is also pertinent to note that Ms. Farrar’s sister, Linda, was employed as the bookkeeper during this time (Annexure **SF8**). The existence of two years of unallocated expenses, despite the presence of a dedicated bookkeeper and an external accountant, raises serious questions about the competence and integrity of the financial administration.

### RE: AD 8.7 - IT Expenses and Tax Problems

**JR 8.7** I deny the allegations. The Applicant’s claim that the IT expenses are “almost entirely unexplainable” is a deliberate misrepresentation. These expenses were legitimate operational costs for the global e-commerce platform, comprising over 51 Shopify stores, which the Second Respondent built and managed. This platform generated approximately R34.9 million in annual revenue. The Applicant deliberately omits this revenue context to create a false impression of exorbitant and unwarranted spending. The Second Respondent will address the specifics of these operational costs in his answering affidavit.

### RE: AD 8.10 & 9.2 - International Expenses and Transfers

**JR 8.10** I deny the allegations. The Applicant’s insinuation of improper international fund transfers is false. I have personal knowledge that the UK-based operations, managed by the Second Respondent, were not draining funds from South Africa. On the contrary, the UK entity, RegimA Zone Ltd, was funding the South African operations. The Second Respondent will provide documentary evidence, including Shopify invoices and UK bank statements, that prove a consistent payment flow from the UK to South Africa (Annexures **DF5-DF8**). The Applicant’s claim is the opposite of the truth.

### RE: AD 9.3 - Financial Misconduct Summary

**JR 9.3** I deny the Applicant’s summary of alleged misconduct. The true financial misconduct, which the Applicant’s affidavit conveniently ignores, is documented in the company’s own records. This includes, but is not limited to:

**JR 9.3.1** **Unauthorized Transfers:** On February 14-15, 2025, two unauthorized transfers totaling R900,000 were made from the RegimA SA account without the knowledge or authority of the Second Respondent, who is a co-director (Annexure **DF9**).

**JR 9.3.2** **Stock Disappearance and Related Party Connection:** A R5.4 million stock adjustment was recorded in Strategic Logistics (SLG), which was explained as the stock having “just disappeared” (Annexure **SF3**). This is the same category of stock that is supplied to RegimA Skin Treatments by Adderory (Pty) Ltd, a company owned by Ms. Rynette Farrar’s son (Annexure **SF5**). In an email related to a SARS audit concerning these amounts, Ms. Farrar claimed that Mr. Bantjies had instructed her to make the substantial payments for this stock (Annexure **SF4**).

**JR 9.3.3** **Unpaid Debt to Deceased Partner’s Estate:** A debt of R1,035,000 has been owed by RegimA Skin Treatments to the estate of the Second Respondent’s late fiancée and business partner, Kayla Pretorius, since February 2023 (Annexure **SF6**). On May 15, 2025, I confronted Ms. Farrar about this unpaid debt, stating that withholding these funds was tantamount to profiting from the proceeds of murder. Ms. Farrar falsely claimed to me that the amount had been paid. To date, it has not.

## ANALYSIS: GRADUAL REVELATION STRATEGY (LAYER 3)

### Layer 3: Revealing the Control Structure & Financial Connections

This section builds upon the timeline inconsistencies established in Section 4 by exposing the underlying network of control and suspicious financial connections. The narrative shifts from questioning the Applicant's story to revealing an alternative, evidence-based reality.

**1. Bantjies's Triple Conflict of Interest (JR 8.4):**
The affidavit explicitly states Mr. Bantjies's three conflicting roles: undisclosed trustee, R18.685M debtor to the trust, and group accountant. By revealing that he received the fraud report and then dismissed an audit, the narrative implies a motive to conceal, without making a direct accusation. The reader is led to question his impartiality and the validity of any “discovery” he made.

**2. The Financial Administration Network (JR 8.5):**
The connection between Bantjies (accountant), Rynette (administrator using Peter's email), and Linda (Rynette's sister and bookkeeper) is established. The fact that two years of expenses went unallocated under their collective watch suggests either gross incompetence or deliberate obfuscation, undermining the credibility of the entire financial team presented by the Applicant.

**3. The Adderory Connection (JR 9.3.2):**
This is a critical link. The narrative connects three facts:
   a. R5.4M in stock “disappeared” from one company (SLG).
   b. The same type of stock is supplied by Adderory.
   c. Adderory is owned by the son of Ms. Farrar, the administrator who controls the accounts.
   d. Ms. Farrar claimed Mr. Bantjies instructed the payments for this stock.

This cluster of facts points towards a potential transfer pricing scheme or related-party fraud, orchestrated by the very people the Applicant relies on. The revelation is made by simply stating the documented facts in sequence.

**4. The Unpaid Estate Debt (JR 9.3.3):**
This point introduces a powerful ethical and emotional dimension to the financial misconduct. It connects the financial irregularities to a personal tragedy (the murder of the Second Respondent's partner) and a direct lie from Ms. Farrar. It demonstrates a pattern of deception and a lack of moral compunction within the financial administration.

### Narrative Technique

- **Connecting the Dots:** Layer 3 is about connecting individuals to suspicious transactions and conflicts of interest. The draft links Bantjies to the audit dismissal, Rynette to the unallocated expenses, and Adderory to the disappearing stock.
- **Implication through Juxtaposition:** Instead of saying, 
"Bantjies orchestrated fraud," the affidavit states: "Bantjies was the accountant, he received the fraud report, he dismissed the audit request." The reader makes the connection.
- **Ethical Dimension:** The introduction of the unpaid debt to Kayla's estate adds moral weight. It's not just about money; it's about honoring the memory of a deceased business partner and the integrity of the business relationships.
- **Foreshadowing Deeper Layers:** The mention of "profiting from the proceeds of murder" and the May 15, 2025 confrontation date sets up the retaliation timeline that will be fully revealed in subsequent sections.

### Evidence Web

The following annexures create a web of interconnected evidence:

| Annexure | Content | Significance |
|----------|---------|--------------|
| **SF1** | Bantjies debt documentation (R18.685M) | Establishes Bantjies's financial motive to prevent discovery |
| **SF2** | Sage screenshots (Rynette using pete@regima.com) | Proves Rynette controlled systems using Applicant's email |
| **SF3** | Strategic Logistics R5.4M stock adjustment | Documents the "disappeared" stock |
| **SF4** | SARS audit email (Rynette claiming Bantjies instructed payments) | Links Bantjies to the suspicious payments |
| **SF5** | Adderory company registration and stock supply documentation | Connects Rynette's son to the same stock type |
| **SF6** | Kayla Pretorius estate documentation (R1,035,000 debt) | Establishes the unpaid debt and false claim |
| **SF8** | Linda employment records (bookkeeper) | Shows Rynette's sister was employed during unallocated expense period |
| **DF3** | Second Respondent's reports to Bantjies (June 6, 2025) | Proves fraud was reported before "discovery" |
| **DF5-DF8** | Shopify invoices and UK bank transactions | Will prove UK → SA payment flow (opposite of Applicant's claim) |
| **DF9** | Unauthorized transfer records (R900K, Feb 14-15, 2025) | Documents transfers without Second Respondent's authority |

### Key Revelations in Layer 3

**1. The Network Emerges:**
- **Bantjies:** Trustee + Accountant + R18.685M Debtor
- **Rynette:** Administrator using Peter's email + Sister employed as bookkeeper
- **Adderory:** Rynette's son + Stock supplier + Same stock type as "disappeared" R5.4M
- **Peter:** Figurehead (no computer, no banking, email controlled by Rynette)

**2. The Financial Irregularities:**
- **R900,000:** Unauthorized transfers without Daniel's authority
- **R5.4M:** Stock "disappeared" from SLG, same type supplied by Adderory
- **R1,035,000:** Unpaid debt to Kayla's estate, Rynette falsely claimed paid
- **2 years:** Unallocated expenses under Bantjies (accountant) + Rynette (system control) + Linda (bookkeeper)

**3. The Pattern of Deception:**
- Bantjies received fraud report → dismissed audit request
- Rynette claimed Bantjies instructed payments for disappeared stock
- Rynette falsely claimed R1,035,000 debt was paid
- Two years of expenses unallocated despite employed bookkeeper and external accountant

**4. The Motive:**
- Bantjies owes R18.685M to the trust
- Had reason to prevent discovery of fraud
- Dismissed audit request after receiving fraud report
- Certified Applicant's affidavit as Commissioner of Oaths

### Cognitive Synergy with Daniel's Affidavit

This section is designed to create synergy with the Second Respondent's affidavit:

**Jacqui's Perspective (This Section):**
- Introduces Bantjies's triple conflict
- Reveals the network (Bantjies-Rynette-Linda-Adderory)
- Establishes the unpaid debt and May 15 confrontation
- Notes the false claim about payment

**Daniel's Perspective (Complementary):**
- Will provide detailed financial analysis of R34.9M operations
- Will prove UK → SA payment flow with invoices and bank statements
- Will detail the R5.4M stock adjustment as 46% of sales, 10x historical
- Will explain IT expenses as 19.3% (2024) and 6.1% (2025) of revenue

**Together They Reveal:**
- Not mismanagement, but systematic fraud
- Not unexplainable expenses, but reasonable costs for R34.9M operations
- Not SA funding UK, but UK funding SA
- Not recent discovery, but deliberate concealment after fraud was exposed

### Connection to Integrated Narrative Framework

This section corresponds to **Act II: Discovery and Confrontation** and **Act III: Systematic Retaliation** in the Integrated Narrative Framework:

**May 15, 2025:** Jacqui confronts Rynette about R1,035,000 debt ("profiting from proceeds of murder")

**May 22, 2025:** Shopify data expunged (7 days later)

**May 29, 2025:** Domain regimaskin.co.za registered by Adderory (14 days later)

**June 6, 2025:** Daniel exposes fraud to Bantjies

**June 7, 2025:** Cards cancelled (1 day later)

**June 10, 2025:** Bantjies dismisses audit request (4 days later)

The revelation of the control structure and financial connections in this section provides the foundation for understanding why the retaliation occurred: Jacqui and Daniel threatened to expose a systematic fraud involving Bantjies (who owed R18.685M), Rynette (whose son benefited from the stock scheme), and a network of related-party transactions.

### Tone and Style Maintained

**Professional Elegance:**
- Formal legal language appropriate for court
- Well-structured paragraphs with clear topic sentences
- Logical progression from general denial to specific evidence

**Neutral Presentation:**
- Facts stated objectively without hyperbole
- Connections implied through juxtaposition, not explicit accusation
- "Raises serious questions" rather than "proves fraud"
- "The same category of stock" rather than "fraudulent transfer"

**Material Evidence Support:**
- Every assertion supported by annexure reference
- Specific amounts, dates, and documents cited
- Financial figures from official records
- Email correspondence and company documentation

### Foreshadowing Layer 4

This section sets up the next layer of revelation (Pattern Emerges) by:

1. Introducing the May 15, 2025 confrontation date
2. Mentioning "profiting from proceeds of murder"
3. Establishing Rynette's false claim about payment
4. Revealing Bantjies's dismissal of audit request after receiving fraud report

These elements will be fully developed in subsequent sections to show the pattern of immediate retaliation after investigating/exposing fraud.
