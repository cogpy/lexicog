‘application.

On 19 August 2025, | was constrained to make application (‘the main
application’) to this Court, under this case number, on an urgent ex
parte basis.

In order to avoid making this. application unduly prolix, | refer to the con-
tents of the main application — which is on Caselines, together with this

application. — as if specifically tepeated and incorporated herein.

The Order of Court annexed hereto, marked “AF1", was issued by ‘this

Honourable Court accordingly.

Ta date hereof, the main application remains pending; all that the first
fespondent has done is file a notice of intention to Oppose (dated 5
September 2025).

Her attorneys (Edward Nathan Sonnenburgs) withdrew as her attorneys
in the main application on or about 24 September 2025.

Due to our personal relationships, a mediation was arranged between
the first and second respondents and | {ail represented by our attor-
neys), which was held on 18 September 2025.

The mediation was successful in that two written agreements resulted
therefrom, copies of which are annexed hereto marked “AF2", and
“AF3” respectively.

Annexure “AF2’ is the mediated agreement dealing with the intended
medical assessments of my wife, and son (the “first agreement’); an-
nexure “AF3” is concerned with forensic investigations into the affairs

of our various entities (the “second agreement’).

As appears from the first agreement, my son agreed to submit to being
Screened for drugs, and my wife agreed to undergo a psychiatric eval-

uation; both my wife, and son agreed to further assistance ard evalua-

tion, subject to views and requests of the relevant experts.

45 For the sake of fairness and transparency, | also agreed to being tested
for drugs, and to.undergo a psychiatric evaluation; | am proceeding with
both.

48 Itis important to note, with fespect, that the aforesaid agreements were
not reached in settlement of the entire matter between the first and sec-

ond respondents, and |.
4.7 As appears from the first agreement, it was recorded that:

4.7.4 A number of disputes arose_in felation to the order granted by
this Court, and the relief sought in respect-of PART B of the pro-

ceedings under the above case number: (Clause 4.1)

472 The parties have agreed to settle in good faith the disputes which
exist between them on the basis set out below, which, subject to
further agreement, does not finalise the aforesaid proceedings.

(Clause 1.2)

4.8 As appears from the second agreement, it was recorded that:

4.8.4 A number of disputes arose in relation to the order granted by

48.2 The parties agree to remain bound by the terms of the aforesaid
order of Court until such a time as sare is set-aside or agree-
ment is reached with regards fo the finalisation of the aforesaid
matter. (Clause 1.3)

4.8.3 Clause 26 provides that pending the mediation referred to in par-
agraph 2.5 above, the time periods for the filing of further papers
in respect of the proceedings under case number 2025-137857
remain suspended, as the proceedings remain pending.

4.8.4 Clause 27 provides that insofar as the court order dated 19 Au-
gust 2025 under case number 2025-137857 is concerned, the

parties agree that paragraph 2.8.3 will be read as follows:

“... are interdicted and directed to answer all questions put
fo them in regard to the forensic investigation and the ex-
perts appointed by the forensic investigators, honestly and
forthrightly.”

4.85 Clause 28 provides that this shall not preclude any party from

approaching a Court for any appropriate or necessary relief.

On 22 September 2025, the respondents informed (annexure “AF 4’
hereto) their attomeys that they ‘withdraw from both agreements; on 23
September 2025 they informed my attorneys thereof, as appears from

same letter forwarded to them on that date.

The lack of coherence in that letter Speaks, with respect, for itself; need-
less to say, with respect, | deny the allegations contained in that docu-
ment, which are untrue.

The respondents’ then attorneys (ENS Attorneys) then withdrew.

| have not accepted the attempted repudiation of the settlement agree-
ments; the respondents are bound thereto, and they are held thereto.

Regrettably, | was again constrained to approach this Honourable
Court, to have that agreement made an order of Court, which | did.

That application became opposed by the first and second respondent,

and remains pending.

affidavit therein (which are also on Caselines, under this case number)

The contents of both applications (being the main applicant and sec-
ond/further application) are, with respect, essential fo this matter,

The first respondent's misconduct has now escalated to such a degree
that | am again compelled to approach Court for urgent relief, as | now

do.

At the end of September 2025, the first respondent, persisting in her
misconduct, commenced harassing the fourth respondent's office per-
sonnel by repeatedly demanding her ‘salary, when none of us have
drawn salaries (by agreement between us) for two to three years: we

‘draw against our loan accounts with our various entities.

AS appears from annexure “AFS" hereto (dated 30 September 2025),
the first respondent emailed many of Regima’s staff members, demand-
ing the payment of her ‘salary’.

itis noteworthy, with respect, that included email with Regima’s general
attorneys, regarding pending litigation concerning Regima, which is not
for the knowledge of its staff; this poses the disruption of Regima’s busi-

ness.

## Page 18

6.5 itis also noteworthy, with respect, that she-refers to Regima’s funds as

being ‘her’ money.
6.6

6.6.1 On or about 29 and 30 September 2025 the first respondent —
who is infuriated by the first order granted against her — then
threatened me by saying that she was going fo head to the fourth
respondent's (‘Regima’) office, to ‘tell all the employees what's
going on within the company’, which will be enormously disrup-

tive to its business.

6.6.2 | pause to mention, with respect, that the aforesaid occurred im-
mediately after her ‘withdrawal from the aforesaid settlement
agreements, the first respondent placing all the ‘blame’ on. her
erstwhile attorneys for her entering into those agreements, which
is unfounded.

67 1, thereupon, advised the first respondent that she would not be wel-
come to attend at the Regima’s offices, which she has in any event not

done for inter alia years.

68 She then demanded that she must attend Regima’s training session on
its products, scheduled for 07 and 08 October 2025. needless to say,

despite the underlying undertakings not to attend, she indeed did so -
to the clear prejudice of the Regima staff.and representatives.

The same day, 30 September 2025, the first respondent sent a further
email (annexure “AF6” hereto) to Regima’s staff (again including corre-
spondence with Regima’s attorneys) demanding that she must attend
the scheduled training, against which | was very opposed, because |
had no doubt whatsoever that she would have used the opportunity to
be disruptive, she having said to me that she would cause a ruckus with
the staff.

Also on 30 September 2025, | caused my attorneys of record to address
urgent correspondence (annexure “AF?” hereto) to her, demanding that
she desist.

The first respondent then, also on 30 September 2025, responded in
writing (annexure “AF8” hereto) undertaking not to attend the training,
which she réconfirmed (annexure “AF9" hereto).

Although | expected that the first respondent would cease causing trou-
ble, she has since or about 25 August 2025 inter alia demanded, that
she be copied in on all Regima’s correspondence.

Unfortunately, Regima’s. staff complied with the first respondent's de-
mand.

An exchange of correspondence (annexure “AF 10" hereto) followed
with Regima SA's accountants, De Novo, in which the first respondent
participated.

Those emails pertained, inter alia, to the unknown transactions as well,
to which the first respondent referred as if they were legitimate pay-
ments to certain suppliers, which they were not (insofar as no infor-
mation has. been provided with regards to them, and attacking Mrs Far-

tar, Regima’s bookkeeper,

That correspondence (from the first respondent) is undoubtedly preju-
dicial, and contravenes paragraph 2.5 of the Order issued by this Court
on 19 August 2025, which reads as follows:

“The First and Second respondents are interdicted arid re-
strained from dealing with the business (and the administration
thereof) of the Third to Sixth Respondents, and/or their employ-
ees, and/or their partners, and/or their clientéle, in any manner in

which any may sustain any prejudice.”

On 1 October 2025, correspondence followed from the first respond-

ent's attorneys in the main application (annexure “AF 11" hereto), to

Page 14/26

## Page 21

which my attorneys responded on 2 October 2025, as appears from

annexure “AF 12” hereto.

Further correspondence followed frorn the first respondent to Regima’s
staff (the latest of which was on 10 October 2025), copies of which are
annexed hereto marked collectively as “AF13”, which is equally uncon-

ducive to the continuation of its business.

Notwithstanding her undertaking not to attend Regima's training ses-

sion (as aforesaid), the respondent in fact attended, as aforesaid,

Correspondence followed from my attorneys (annexure “AF 14” hereto);
the staff member to whom reference was made therein is Ms Gayane
Williams; the content thereof speaks, with respect, for itself (Ms. Wil-
liam's confirmatory affidavit shall bé attached hereto as annexure

“AF15").

After the training session, the two contract representatives. mentioned
in that correspondence contacted our offices, and asked if their jobs
were still safe — which is confirmed by Ms Williams herein aforesaid.

| can only imagine what she said to them; | have no doubt that the afore-

said was massively detrimental to Regima’s business.

AD ESCALATION

91 The aforesaid contemptuous conduct occurred over approximately two
weeks, and | had hoped that it would cease ~ respectfully, this continues
to be my hope, however, it has unfortunately been confirmed by the first

respondent's conduct, herein below, that this will not be the case.

92 From Wednesday 22 October 2025, the first respondent's conduct has
escalated to a point where | can no longer sit back and attempt to ‘put
out’ the continuous ‘fires’ the respondent creates with employees, sup-

pliers, and other third parties.

9.3 The first respondent's. conduct is not only contemptuous, and detri-
mental to Regima’s business, but is also increasingly erratic, for in-
slance, on 22 October 2025, the. respondent called our bookkeeper
(Mrs Rynetle Farrar), and demanded that she send letters to confirm
that we would not release Regima’s stock to the United Kingdom
branch, which was completely illogical since no payment has been re-

ceived therefrom, although it was requested.

9.4 She also, on 22 October 2025, grabbed the telephone from Mr Arthur
Mphande, who manages our storage and stock, whilst he was on the

phone with Mrs Lynette Kruger, employed by Regima and who was
checking stock levels of raw materials for manufacturing purposes, and

forbade him from releasing stock from storage.

On 23 October 2025, she then removed ‘the Regima phone from Ar-
thur's possession, effectively ending all Regima’s deliveries, and sup-

plies.

Annexed hereto, marked “AF1?’, is a copy of Arthur's WhatsApp mes-
sage to ‘Linda’ (Lynette Kruger). Her confirmatory affidavit is annexed
hereto marked “AF 18”.

! also annex transcripts of the aforesaid calls of 22 October 2025 hereto
marked collectively as “AF19”".

i can only hope that our staff do not leave (citing constructive dismis-
Sals) before this Honourable Court intervenes again; undoubtedly, with
fespect, the first respondent will not stop harassing our staff, and sup-

pliers.

10.

Since 22 October 2025, the first respondent launched what can only be
described as a ‘full out’ attack on Regima’s staff:

## Page 24

10.1,1

10.1.2

10.1.3

10.1.4

She emailed our bookkeeper, twice (per annexure “AF20"
hereto) taking, insofar as | can ascertain, umbrage at her photo-
graph in her email footer (as all our staff have in their email foot-

ers);

On 23 October 2025, she launched a barrage of complaints per-
taining to Regima no longer dealing with Shopify, and sent emails
in that regard, which | annex hereto marked “AF 21": notably, the
parties to whom reference was therein made, were ordering from
inter alia salons, per the contents of the emails themselves;
Shopify was unrelated thereto: the orders were, however, sorted
out by our staff:

She addressed further correspondence to Regima’s staff, on or
about 23 October 2025 (annexure “AF22” hereto), to addressees
including unrelated employees, alleging (unfoundedly) the theft
of (inter alia) pension funds. (these allegations are so untrue and
vexatious that | cannot even address them at all, save to deny

same).

She then sent our staff emails (annexure “AF23” hereto) includ-

ing makeup tips, which | can only deem harassment.

10.1.5 Also on 23 October 2025, the first respondent called Mrs Farrar

14.2

11.3

11.4

on her telephone, regarding the aforesaid. The transcript thereof
is annexed hereto marked “AF 24”.

11.

The first respondent's conduct must, with respect, be halted:

As | have already indicated, it is only a matter of very little time before
Regima’s staff resign, to their significant detriment, and to Regima’s sig-

nificant detriment.

That will be, with respect, the end of Regima’s business, to ifs detriment,
my detriment, and to the detriment of the first and second respondents

as well; we are all sustained by the businesses.

seek, accordingly, infer alfa, an order interdicting the first respondent
from having any contact whatsoever with Regima, its staff, its suppliers,
and its customers; the Order issued by this Honourable Court is specific
tegarding ‘prejudicial conduct; while the first respondent's individual in-
stances. of misbehaviour are not always so glaring as to be considered

prejudicial, the cumulative effect thereof certainly is.

115 Regima's business, its employees, the first and second respondents,
and |, stand to be prejudiced irreparably if an interdict is not grarited as
sought.

116 The respondent will not, with respect, desist unless an interdict is

granted as sought in the notice of motion.
42.
AD SATISFACTION OF THE REQUIREMENTS FOR Al R CT
12.1 | say, with respect, that.1 have very well grounded reasons to believe
that Regima, its employees, the first and second respondents, and I,
will be prejudiced irreparably if an interdict is not granted as sought:
12.2 | have a prima facie right to the relief | seek;
12.3 The balance of convenience favours me overwhelmingly;
12.4 | have no adequate alternative remedy.
12.5 As appears from the notice of motion, | seek the relief set out therein

pending the adjudication of PART B of the notice of motion in the main

application.

12.6.1

12.6.2

Although the first respondent's conduct is contra the Order made
on 19 August 2025, and may justify an order finding her to be in
contempt of the Order granted by this Honourable Court on 19
August 2025, it can be argued by the first respondent that her
conduct is not prejudicial, as envisaged in the aforesaid Order of
Court.

| believe, and say with respect that an interdict as sought — that
she may have no contact whatsoever with the third to sixth re-
Spondenis, their employees, and/or their partners, and/or their
clentéle — is necessary to protect them, and. her, and our son,

and {.

13.

As | stated in the application | have lodged to have the aforesaid settle-

ment agreements made an Order of Court, the first respondent has also

become extremely inconsistent, and erratic in her ‘management’ of our

entities, for example, after agreeing to business decisions, and signing

agreements, she has thereafter stated her disagreement therewith, in

ho uncertain terms, and has taken exception to (according to her) the

‘sudden opening of savings accounts’ for our entities with ABSA Bank,

which have been open for years.

14.1

While | am not a medical practitioner, it is evident to me that something

is now very wrong with my wife, to the extent that she is no longer ca-

pable of participating in the management of our entities, which must be
protected from her.

There must, with respect, be an explanation for the deterioration in her
behaviour. My only concerns are their well-being (my wife and my son),
and the well-being of our entities, which sustain all of us.

Fortunately, | manage the day-to-day running of the affairs of the entities
concerned, and | have seen thereto that my wife, and son, continue to

receive their usual benefits as directors.

Similarly to our son, my wife cannot appreciate that | am acting in her
best interests, and in the best interests of the entities that sustain us.

14.

cy

This Court has already found, with respect, for an Order interdicting the
first respondent:

Page 22/26

## Page 29

“.. from dealing with the business (and the administration
thereo) of the Third to Sixth Respondents, and/or their employ-
ees, and/or their pariners, and/or their clientéle, in any manner in

which any may sustain any prejudice.”

442 The events after that Order was granted have only made the necessity

of obtaining a further Order against the first respondent even more ur-
gent.

14.3 if the first respondent is not stopped immediately, Regima’s business,
iis employees, the first and second respondents, and |, stand to be prej-

udiced irreparably if an interdict is not granted as sought.

14.4 | Say with respect that | have no prospects of obtaining substantial re-
dress in due course if the further Order | séek is not now granted: the
first respondent will certainly persist in her conduct, the inevitable immi-
nent result of which will be that Regima’s business will collapse, to its
irreparable detriment, and to.the irreparable detriment of my wife, son,
and | — as well as our employees and their families that rely on their

income.

145 The first respondent has, further, and on or about 29 October 2025,
started to respond to emails regarding orders, with a tejection thereof
on the grounds of ‘fraud’.

**RE: CASE NO. 2025-137857 - NOTICE OF ' WITHDRAWAL FROM SETT! LEMENT AGREEMENTS DATED,
18 SEPTEMBER 2025**

Dear Sirs,

We referto the above matter and the purported settlement agreements signed on 18 September
2025. .

Ht 1. WITHDRAWAL FROM AGREEMENTS

We hereby give notice of our immediate withdrawal from all settlement agreements signed on 18
September 2025 based on multipte grounds, each independently sufficient to void these agreements.

## 2, GROUNDS FOR WITHDRAWAL
#44-2.1 IMMEDIATE FUNDAMENTAL BREACH BY PETER FAUCITT

On 19 September 2025, merely one-day after signing, Peter Faucitt materially breached the
settlement by:


---

## Page 51

 

- Physically preventing Jacqueline Faucitt from performing her legal duties regarding POPIA ”
compliance

- Claiming he "controls all the companies now" - exceeding his financial-only mandate under the.
interdict

- Assaulting an employee by grabbing their phone

- Obstructing legal compliance that coutd result in R10 mittion regulatory fines

This immediate repudiation releases us from any obligations.
##i# 2.2 MATERIAL NON-DISCLOSURE _
We have discovered that material information was deliberately inenelth

~ **June 10, 2025 correspondence** between Daniel Faucitt and Danie Bantjies regarding financial
irregularities was not discloséd

- **R12,330,131.18 was transferred** on supposedly protected accounts on September 11, 2025 -
seven days before mediation
- These material facts were known to your client and his advisors but concealed from us

This non-disclosure vitiates any consent.
### 2.3 DURESS AND COERCION:
The agreements were signed under duress:

- We were told refusing would result in being "bound until 2029 with no earlier relief"
« Medical testing was presented as mandatory for mediation

= We had no meaningful choice :

- The true nature of proceedings was misrepresented

### 2.4 ABSENCE OF LEGITIMATE DISPUTES
Review of corresponderice reveals no actual disputes existed:

- June 2025 emails show collaborative investigation of financial irregutarities

- Matters raised were crimes requiring investigation, not interpersonat disputes
- No Terms of Reference defined any disputes

~Nothing was actually "settled"

‘Without defined disputes, the settlement lacks consideration and'serves no purpose.
### 2.5 IMPOSSIBLE AND UNCERTAIN TERMS
The agreements contain:

- No defined scope or disputes being resolved

- Vague, uncertain provisions

- Medical requirements inappropriate for business matters

- Mixed therapeutic and legal purposes that are incompatible

These fundamental uncertainties render the agreements void.

2


---

## Page 52

 

Hi# 2.6 PROCEDURAL IRREGULARITIES

The mediation lacked basic Procedural requirements: _

~ No Terms of Reference |

- No mediation agreement .

- Presented as “family therapy" not tegat Proceedings

- "Off-the-racord” nature incompatible with binding agreements

- No clear exchange of Consideration

HHH 2.7 ILLEGALITY AND PUBLIC POLICY

The agreements appear designed to:

- Prevent reporting of crimes to authorities

'- Suppress evidence of financial irregularities

- Circumvent legal compliance obligations

Agreements for illegal purposes are void as against public policy,

##3. LEGAL POSITION

Based onthe above, the settlement agreements are:

- **Void-ab initio** for illegality, impossibility, and lack of consensus

- **Voidable** for duress, misrepresentation, and non-disclosure
~**Terminated** by Peter Faucitt's immediate fundamental breach
~**Unenforceable** for uncertainty and procedural defects

#4# 4. DEMANDS

We accordingly demand:

4.1 Immediate written Confirmation that the Settlement agreements are terminated
4.2 Confirmation that no enforcement will be attempted

4.3 Cancellation of all medical assessments

4.4 Cessation of all actions based on these void agreements:

## 5. RESERVATION OF RIGHTS

We reserve all our rights, including but not limited to:

- Seeking urgent court relief if these agreements are not acknowledged as void
- Pursuing claims for damages arising from the breaches ‘

~Reporting relevant matters to appropriate authorities :
~ Taking any steps necessary to protect our interests G

## Page 53

## 6. INTERDICT MATTERS

Subject: Bank Statements / Unknown transfers

Good morning
Hope you all are keeping well.
| have sent through all the bank statements requested yesterday.

| have looked at the schedule of unknown transfers, and the only one that I can identify for sure is the
transaction on the 13" of July 2022 for R25 000.00, as | saw correspondence with Barend from
Dermal Skin. This total Barend has taken, so it would have been transferred to one of his private /
business accounts.

The rest | do not known, and Barend say it is transfers that Danny has done, so Barend does not know
either. Danny at this moment is not giving us any co-operation, so | cannot ask him. As far as I’m
concerned, the amounts that were not paid directly to us at Regima Skin, were done to one of
Barend’s accounts. | seem to recall that the R25 000’s, R50 000’, R45 000’s amounts all went to
Barend accounts to cover his expenses as a distributor.

Also, these descriptions used for these transfers does not make sense at all. Like there is one
transaction that refer to AOD, which is Barend customer account with Regima Skin, but! do not see
that amount as being transferred into this account.

Sorry, | could not be of more help.

Regards

1. The above matter refers as does your correspondence dated 30 September 2025 and the
response received from Jacqueline Faucitt (“Jacqui”) in response thereto.

2, At the outset, we record the fact that we have been approached by Jacqui and Daniel James
Faucitt (“our clients”) to consider the potential anticipation and setting aside of the urgent
ex parte order that was granted against them on 19 August 2025.

3. In this regard, the order obtained against our clients interdicts and restrains them, pending
the determination of the relief sought under Part B of the notice of motion, from, inter alia,

their employees, partners, and clientele, “in any manner in which any may sustain any
Prejudice’.

» Regima is a medically recognised and highly specialised range of skin treatments,
developed more than 33 years ago by Jacqui, who remains the Chief Executive Officer and
Head of Regima. She is, and remains, the lead trainer at Regima.

- The Regima product range is widely used by plastic surgeons and other medical
practitioners and has achieved international recognition for its effectiveness and safety. The
use of the products however requires proper training and only those persons who are
certified as competent may apply the Regima products due to the potential for serious bodily
harm to be suffered as a result of the improper use and application of the products.

. To this end, we have been instructed by our clients that prior to the obtaining of the interdict,
a training course was scheduled for 7 to 8 October 2025 for therapists to be trained in using
the Regima product range.

. Given that our client, Jacqui, is the original designer of the treatments, the lead trainer, and
the only individual with comprehensive knowledge of the products’ methodology and

application, her involvement in training is essential.

. Furthermore, the training process is stringent. Therapists are required to pass both a written
examination and a practical assessment. This is due to the potential for physical harm in
the event of the improper use of the products.

. The presence of our client at the upcoming training course is essential and will ensures that
the attendees are properly instructed, trained, and supervised, and that they acquire the
necessary confidence and skill to administer these treatments safely.

40. Notwithstanding the above, you and your client have taken the view that should our client

attend to train these therapists, she will be in contempt of the order. This interpretation of

the order is manifestly wrong.

## Page 78

Page 3

11.None of the paragraphs in the order prevent our client from attending to train the therapists
and we are at a loss to understand how her conduct could result in the businesses, their
employees, partners and clientele sustaining any form of prejudice.

12.To the extent that you disagree, you are specifically required to set out the prejudice which
you contend may be suffered should our client attend to train the therapists during the
course.

13. There cannot however be any conceivable prejudice and, in our view, our client’s intended
conduct does not constitute a breach of the order. The order cannot be interpreted to wholly
exclude our clients from the business of the various Regima entities.

14. We accordingly afford you a period of until close of business on Thursday, 2 October 2025
to substantiate your client's position which, for the reasons already advanced, is improper.

15.Apart from the above, we request that you urgently invite the following profiles to Court
Online and CaseLines so that we can advise our clients:

15.1. lan Levitt — ian@ianlevitt.co.za (Court Online and CaseLines); and

15.2. Natan Back — natan@ianlevitt.co.za (CaseLines).

16. We await your urgent response and reserve all of our clients' rights.

Yours faithfully,

Dear Sir / Madam,

RE: PETER ANDREW FAUCITT // JACQUELINE FAUCITT & DANIEL JAMES FAUCITT & 7 OTHERS

CASE NO: 2025-137857

The above-mentioned matter refers, as well as your correspondence received on 01 October 2025.

We advise that the content thereof has been noted, and confirm that any aspect thereof not

admitted herein, should be deemed denied.

We further reserve our client’s rights to address same in the appropriate forum or form, or in due

In introduction, it would seem that your office has not been placed in complete instructions — we

suggest that same be obtained prior to considering any anticipation application, or the like.

in this regard, we pause to note as follows:

1. Your clients’ agreed to abide by the order, through their erstwhile attorneys of record;

2. Your clients’ have undersigned two separate agreements, subsequent to our client obtaining

an order;

3. The agreements reconfirm that your clients will abide by the order of Court, and further
proceed to inter alia supplement the relief through agreement to drug testing and

psychometric assessments;

4. Respectfully, not only have your clients’ been well-aware of the order, they agreed not only

to uphold the order, but to further same;

5. A reconsideration, in the circumstances, would be ill-advised;

6. We pause to note that our client, in compliance therewith, is proceeding with both — his

psychometric assessment having started on even date;

7. Your clients, more specifically Mrs Faucitt, have already contravened the order — our client
would be well within his rights to proceed with contempt of Court proceedings, but has, at

present, refrained therefrom inter alia in the interests of the family bonds;

8. Weill, herein below, delineate hereupon — it should be noted that this list is not

exhaustive:

a. Your client has contacted staff telephonically to warn them of impending changes in

the entities, which may affect the staff's employment — which is prejudicial;

b. Your client has emailed numerous staff with inter alia unnecessary and prejudicial

statements:

15.

The training was scheduled so that a company representative could provide the training (as

is generally done), and not your client;

Your client has not partaken in each and every training session (and has in this regard
happily allowed company representatives to present the training), and has not attended to
the office regularly in any event since the present building was purchased — approximately

10 years ago;

To aver that there will be any issue with the training or products, should she not attend to

the training, is unfounded;

We agree that the order does not specifically interdict your clients from attending at the
business — however, it is clear from your clients present conduct (most specifically Mrs
Faucitt) that any attendance to the business will likely result in prejudicial allegations and/or

statements being made;

It is our client’s considered view that your client’s request to attend at the business is not made in

good faith.

We reserve our client’s rights herein in toto.

We further request that you serve a notice of appointment as attorneys of record herein, so as to

confirm same.

Cor Jacqui Faucitt’ <jax@regima.zone>; linda@regimaskin.co.za
Subject: Bank Statements / Unknown transfers

Good morning
Hope you all are keeping well.
| have sent through all the bank statements requested yesterday.

[have looked at the schedule of unknown transfers, and the only one that | can identify for sure is the
transaction on the 13" of July 2022 for R25 000.00, as | saw correspondence with Barend from
Dermal Skin. This total Barend has taken, so it would have been transferred to one of his private /
business accounts.

The rest | do not known, and Barend say itis transfers that Danny has done, so Barend does not know
aither. Danny at this moment is not giving us any co-operation, so! cannot ask him. As faras I’m
concerned, the amounts that were not paid directly to us at Regima Skin, were done to one of
Barend’s accounts. | seem to recall that the R25 000’s, R50 000’, R45 000’s amounts all went to
Barend accounts to cover his expenses as @ distributor.

Also, these descriptions used for these transfers does not make sense at all. Like there is one
transaction that refer to AOD, which is Barend customer account with Regima Skin, but Ido not see
that amount as being transferred into this account,

Sorry, } could not be of more help.

Regards

Dear Sir / Madam,

RE: PETER ANDREW FAUCITT // JACQUELINE FAUCITT & DANIEL JAMES FAUCITT & 7 OTHERS

CASE NO: 2025-137857

The above-mentioned matter refers, as well as your correspondence received on 01 October 2025.

We wish to advise that we have not yet received the courtesy of a response to our prior
correspondence (dated 02 October 2025).

With reference to the aforesaid, and despite your client’s undertaking not to attend the relevant
training, we are instructed that your client indeed so attended the training on both the 6" and 7® of
October 2025.

There was inter alia one (1) employee present, two (2) contract representatives present, and fifteen
(15) therapists representing Salons, present.

Your client inter alia advised the employee present, that she had been “indoctrinated”, and that
when your client returns to “power”, your client stated that staff members would be leaving with
their tail between their legs, and inter alia advised the two (2) contract representatives that their
jobs were still safe.

Our client was unable to obtain details pertained to the entirety of the discussions held, however,
has been specifically advised to the aforesaid.

Save for as above, your client has (with further specific reference to Mrs Faucitt) emailed further
staff members, specifically on the 10" of October 2025, in aspects which can inter alia, only be
deemed negative and/or prejudicial, and in contravention of the order.

Our client, as should be evident, from the papers filed of record, is hesitant to proceed with
contempt of court proceedings, however, it would seem that our client is effectively being left with
no recourse but to do so, due to your client’s continued conduct.

We accordingly await your urgent response herein — we are instructed to demand same within 48
hours hereof.

We are instructed, based on the correspondence and court documentation herein, that the
following is now evident:

Subject: REGIMA : DISCONTINUATION

Good afternoon

l have been a loyal RegimA customer for around 14/15 years, with no tess than 9 of your RegimA products
making up my current skincare regime; one of my favourite being Anti-Inflamm-Ageing, which has done
wonders to stave off occasional eczema episodes.

Unfortunately, and most disappointingly, due to the difficulty and frustration experienced with
ordering/obtaining RegimA products since moving to KZN’s South Coast 5 years ago, | have decided to phase
out these products and switch brands.

Regards
Diane Oliver

Hi Rynette,

Yes,we have sorted this out with Diane. She never tesponded to my email
but has been communicating directly with Romy.

Tt seems like she is frustrated with the ordering process with Renu -You-
Beauty.

I have asked Romy to follow up with Teane and tesolve this problem.
In the interim »Romy has purchased all the products for Diane and will
personally deliver them to her when she receives the order.

She hasn't switched brands and is still happy to continue with RegimA just
frustrated that the products first have to be ordered for het and then on
top of this, have to pay a courier fee.

Kind Regards
Sharon
