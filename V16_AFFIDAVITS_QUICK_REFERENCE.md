## Key Improvements by Section

### Section 7: Discovery of Financial Irregularities

**Now Includes:**
- Specific operational scale: 51 Shopify stores, R34.9M revenue
- Evidence proportionality: 19% (2024) → 6% (2025) IT costs
- B2B infrastructure: 1100+ salon tenants
- Timeline: Fraud reported 6 June, cards cancelled 7 June (retaliation)
- Causation: Applicant created "unexplained" situation by blocking documentation

**Example (DR 7.1):**
```
The Second Respondent disputes the allegations in AD 7.1. The IT expenses 
were legitimate business expenses necessary to support a complex e-commerce 
infrastructure generating R34.9 million in annual revenue across 51 Shopify 
stores. Mr. Bantjies was informed of these operations in detailed reports 
on 6 June 2025.
```

### Section 10: Grounds for Delinquency Declaration

**Now Includes:**
- Specific statutory references: Section 76, Section 162(5) Companies Act
- Whistleblower defense: "reported fraud to Mr. Bantjies 6 June 2025"
- Success evidence: "R34.9M annual operations" contradicts allegations
- Legal requirements: "gross abuse", "intentional harm" not demonstrated

**Example (DR 10.3):**
```
The Second Respondent denies the allegations in AD 10.3. The Second Respondent 
has not breached any fiduciary duties. On the contrary, the Second Respondent 
acted as a whistleblower by reporting fraud to Mr. Bantjies on 6 June 2025, 
fulfilling fiduciary duties to protect the companies.

## Cross-Reference Guide

### Daniel (DR) and Jacqueline (JR) Synergy

**Complementary Responses:**
- **DR 7.1 + JR 7.1** → Both confirm 51 stores, R34.9M operations
- **DR 7.4 + JR 7.4** → Independent confirmation of professional conduct
- **DR 7.7 + JR 7.7** → Both emphasize retaliation pattern (7 June)
- **DR 10.3 + JR 10.3** → Both position as whistleblowers

**Strategic Value:**
Two independent voices telling the same story = stronger credibility

### Response-to-Annexure Mapping

**Key Mappings:**

- **DR/JR 9.x** → SF1 (Bantjies debt), Power Structure analysis
- **DR/JR 10.x** → All SF series (smoking gun evidence)
