**Court:** High Court of South Africa, Gauteng Division, Pretoria  
**Prepared by:** Manus AI

## Executive Summary

This report presents a comprehensive analysis of the cogpy/canima legal repository and provides refined answering affidavits for Jacqueline Faucitt (First Respondent) and Daniel Faucitt (Second Respondent) in response to Peter Faucitt's founding affidavit and the ex parte order granted on 19 August 2025. The analysis reveals significant material non-disclosures in the Applicant's founding affidavit, particularly regarding the undisclosed role and conflicts of interest of Mr. Danie Jacobus Bantjes as a co-trustee of the Faucitt Family Trust.

The refined affidavits systematically address all AD paragraphs in sequential order, incorporate proper legal citations to statutory provisions and common law principles, and present a compelling counter-narrative demonstrating that the ex parte order was obtained through abuse of process. The affidavits establish that the Applicant's allegations are a retaliatory response to the Second Respondent's whistleblowing regarding serious financial irregularities perpetrated by the Applicant's own agents.

## 2. Legal Research Conducted

### 2.1. Companies Act No. 71 of 2008

**Section 162: Delinquency and Probation Orders**

The research established that delinquency declarations require proof of conduct of a "very serious nature" constituting "gross abuse" of the position of director. Key findings include:

- **High Threshold:** Ordinary negligence or business disagreements are insufficient; conduct must be egregious and go beyond mere negligence.
- **Grounds for Mandatory Delinquency:** Include gross abuse of position, taking personal advantage of information, gross negligence, wilful misconduct, breach of trust, and fraudulent conduct.
- **Material Non-Disclosure:** Failure to disclose material facts in ex parte applications can invalidate orders and may itself constitute abuse of process.

**Section 163: Oppression Remedies**

The research confirmed that conduct is oppressive or unfairly prejudicial if it:
- Lacks commercial probity or fair dealing
- Is contrary to equity, good conscience, and fairness
- Discriminates unfairly between members/beneficiaries
- Disregards legitimate expectations
- Abuses majority power or fiduciary position

### 2.2. Trust Property Control Act No. 57 of 1988

**Section 9: Care, Diligence and Skill Required of Trustee**

Section 9(1) establishes an objective standard requiring trustees to act with the care, diligence, and skill reasonably expected of a person managing another's affairs. Section 9(2) renders void any trust instrument provision that would exempt a trustee from liability for breach of trust where the trustee fails to meet this standard.

**Conflict of Interest and Undisclosed Trustees**

The research established that:
- Beneficiaries are entitled to know the identity of all trustees
- Concealment of trustee identity breaches the duty of transparency
- Undisclosed trustees with financial conflicts of interest cannot act impartially
- Self-dealing and conflict of interest are grounds for trustee removal under Section 20

### 2.3. Ex Parte Applications and Uberrima Fides

Ex parte applications require utmost good faith (uberrima fides), including:
- Full and frank disclosure of all material facts
- Disclosure of facts favorable and unfavorable to applicant
- Disclosure of facts that might influence the court's decision
- No suppression or misrepresentation

Consequences of material non-disclosure include discharge of the ex parte order, costs consequences, and potential findings of abuse of process.

## 3. Material Non-Disclosures Identified

### 3.1. Undisclosed Trustee: Danie Jacobus Bantjes

The most critical material non-disclosure is the Applicant's failure to inform the Court that Mr. Bantjes, who is presented in the founding affidavit as an independent accountant, is in fact:

1. **A co-trustee of the Faucitt Family Trust** alongside Peter and Jacqueline Faucitt
2. **Financially beholden to Peter Faucitt**, owing him R18.685 million
3. **The recipient of Daniel's fraud report on 6 June 2025**, which he dismissed
4. **The Commissioner of Oaths** who commissioned Peter's founding affidavit

### 3.2. Bantjes' Multiple Conflicts of Interest

**Accountant-Trustee Dual Role:**
- Professional duties to client (Peter/companies) conflict with fiduciary duties to beneficiaries (including Daniel)
- Self-review threat: auditing own work as trustee
- Professional independence compromised

**Financial Interest: R18.685M Debt:**
- Direct financial interest in trust administration
- Incentive to conceal financial irregularities
- Motivation to prevent scrutiny of trust finances
- Cannot act impartially

**Dismissal of Fraud Report:**
- Daniel reported Villa Via fraud on 6 June 2025
- Bantjes dismissed audit request on 10 June 2025
- Claimed "going on holiday" as excuse
- Breach of duty to investigate and protect trust assets

### 3.3. Timeline Demonstrating Retaliation

The timeline of events reveals the retaliatory nature of the Applicant's actions:

- **6 June 2025:** Daniel submits detailed fraud report to Bantjes
- **7 June 2025:** Peter cancels all business bank cards (one day later)
- **10 June 2025:** Bantjes dismisses audit request
- **Mid-June 2025:** Alleged "discovery" of IT expense irregularities
- **16 July 2025:** Alleged R500,000 "birthday gift" transfer
- **19 August 2025:** Ex parte order granted (two months after alleged discovery)

### 3.4. True Financial Irregularities Concealed

The Applicant's focus on legitimate IT expenses serves to conceal the true financial irregularities that Daniel exposed:

1. **Villa Via 86% Profit Extraction:** Villa Via Arcadia No 2 CC extracted excessive profits from the group through inflated rent charges
2. **R5.4M Stock Adjustment:** Strategic Logistics CC processed a fraudulent "stock adjustment" in 2024
3. **R900,000 Unauthorized Transfers:** Unauthorized transfers from RegimA SA in February 2025
4. **R1.035M Debt:** RegimA Skin Treatments CC owes R1,035,000 to Rezonance (Pty) Ltd (Kayla Pretorius estate)
5. **Revenue Diversion:** Systematic hijacking of revenue streams through RegimA SA (commenced 1 March 2025) and RegimA Worldwide (commenced 14 April 2025)

## 5. Strategic Recommendations

### 5.1. Immediate Actions

**Annexure Preparation:**
All cited annexures must be meticulously prepared, clearly labelled, and cross-referenced in the affidavits. Priority annexures include:

- JR-1.3 / DR-1.3: Trust Deed of Faucitt Family Trust (showing Bantjes as trustee)
- JR-1.4 / DR-1.4: Loan agreement showing Bantjes' R18.685M debt to Peter
- JR-3.6 / DR-3.6: Daniel's report to Bantjes dated 6 June 2025
- JR-7.5 / DR-7.5: Timeline of events demonstrating retaliation
- JR-6.1 / DR-6.1: Affidavit of Ms. Farrar confirming her exclusive financial control
- DR-3.7: Email from Ms. Farrar regarding SARS audit and R5.4M stock adjustment

**Heads of Argument:**
The legal arguments introduced in the affidavits must be fully developed in Heads of Argument with comprehensive reference to:
- Case law on material non-disclosure in ex parte applications
- Case law on conflict of interest and trustee removal
- Statutory provisions (Companies Act Sections 162, 163, 77; Trust Property Control Act Sections 9, 20)
- Case law on oppression remedies
- Case law on urgency and self-created urgency

### 5.2. Counter-Application

Serious consideration should be given to filing a counter-application seeking:

1. **Removal of Peter Faucitt as Trustee:** Based on oppressive conduct and abuse of trust powers
2. **Removal of Danie Bantjes as Trustee:** Based on conflict of interest and breach of fiduciary duties
3. **Appointment of Independent Trustee:** To protect trust assets and beneficiary interests
4. **Independent Forensic Audit:** Covering full scope of financial irregularities including Villa Via, R5.4M stock adjustment, R900K transfers, and revenue diversion
5. **Costs on Punitive Scale:** Against Peter Faucitt personally for abuse of process
6. **Oppression Relief:** Under Section 163 of the Companies Act

### 5.3. Defensive Strategy

**Discharge of Ex Parte Order:**
The primary objective must be the immediate discharge of the ex parte order based on:
- Material non-disclosure of Bantjes' role and conflicts
- Lack of genuine urgency (two-month unexplained delay)
- Self-created urgency through card cancellations
- Abuse of ex parte procedure to prevent full disclosure

**Reframing the Narrative:**
The affidavits successfully reframe the narrative from "Daniel's misconduct" to:
- Peter's retaliatory attack on whistleblower
- Peter's systematic sabotage of profitable business
- Peter's concealment of his agents' fraud
- Peter's abuse of trust powers and court process

## 6. Legal Principles Applied

### 6.1. Delinquency Applications

The threshold for delinquency declarations is high, requiring egregious conduct constituting gross abuse. The Applicant's allegations of unexplained IT expenses for a R34.9M global e-commerce operation do not meet this threshold. Conversely, the Applicant's own conduct (material non-disclosure, retaliatory actions, sabotage of business operations) may meet the threshold for delinquency or probation under Section 162(7)(c) (oppressive conduct).

### 6.2. Trustee Fiduciary Duties

Bantjes' multiple conflicts of interest constitute clear breaches of his fiduciary duties under Section 9 of the Trust Property Control Act and common law. His failure to investigate Daniel's fraud report, his dismissal of the audit request, and his participation in the ex parte application against a beneficiary are all grounds for his removal under Section 20.

### 6.3. Oppression and Unfair Prejudice

The Applicant's pattern of conduct meets the legal test for oppression under Section 163:
- Card cancellations manufactured crisis
- Revenue diversion systematically implemented
- Sabotage of business operations
- Ex parte interdict as culmination of oppressive campaign
- Retaliatory delinquency application against whistleblower

### 6.4. Material Non-Disclosure

The failure to disclose Bantjes' role as conflicted, undisclosed trustee is a material non-disclosure that fatally taints the ex parte application. The Court is entitled to discharge the order and award punitive costs to mark its disapproval of this abuse of process.

---

## 7. Conclusion

The refined affidavits provide a robust and comprehensive response to the Applicant's founding affidavit. They systematically dismantle the false narrative of the Second Respondent's misconduct and replace it with a compelling counter-narrative grounded in evidence and legal principle. The material non-disclosure of Bantjes' role and conflicts provides a strong foundation for the discharge of the ex parte order.

The legal research conducted establishes the applicable legal framework and demonstrates that the Applicant's conduct, not the Respondents', meets the threshold for delinquency, oppression, and abuse of process. The strategic recommendations provide a clear roadmap for the next steps in the litigation.

All work has been committed and pushed to the cogpy/canima repository for review and further development.
