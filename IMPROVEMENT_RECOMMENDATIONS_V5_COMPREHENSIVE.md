- **AD 10.9.2:** Per Section 162(5)(c)(iii), Intentionally, or by gross negligence,

- ... and 5 more serious allegations

**Recommendations:**

1. Provide detailed factual responses to each serious allegation
2. Present documentary evidence contradicting false allegations
3. Establish timeline context (e.g., fraud report on 6 June, card cancellation on 7 June)
4. Highlight material non-disclosures in Applicant's affidavit
5. Demonstrate pattern of venire contra factum proprium (acting contrary to own conduct)

### 4.2 Material Non-Disclosures

The Applicant failed to disclose critical information:

**Bantjies is third trustee of Faucitt Family Trust**
- Status: Not disclosed
- Impact: Invalidates claim of impartial investigation

**Bantjies owes Peter R18.685M**
- Status: Not disclosed
- Impact: Direct financial interest in preventing fraud discovery

**Revenue context for IT expenses (R34.9M operation)**
- Status: Not disclosed
- Impact: IT expenses appear excessive without revenue context

**Recommendations:**

1. Explicitly identify material non-disclosures in responses
2. Explain the impact of each non-disclosure on the court's assessment
3. Demonstrate how non-disclosures undermine Applicant's credibility
4. Link non-disclosures to specific AD paragraphs

### 4.3 Conflicts of Interest

Critical conflicts of interest must be highlighted:

**Danie Bantjies**
- Conflict: Irreconcilable multiple roles with competing interests
- Legal Breach: Trust Property Control Act s9(1) - Duty to act in beneficiaries' interests
- Impact: Unable to impartially investigate fraud reported by beneficiary Daniel

**Peter Faucitt**
- Conflict: Trustee attacking beneficiaries of own trust
- Legal Breach: Trust Property Control Act s9(1) - Fiduciary duty to beneficiaries
- Impact: Using trust-owned companies and assets to attack beneficiaries

**Rynette Farrar**
- Conflict: Unauthorized control with undisclosed related party transactions
- Legal Breach: Companies Act s76 - Unauthorized exercise of powers
- Impact: Two years unallocated expenses, R5.4M stock adjustment fraud

**Recommendations:**

1. Emphasize Bantjies' multiple conflicting roles when responding to Section 9
2. Highlight Peter's conflict as trustee attacking beneficiaries
3. Demonstrate how conflicts undermine investigation credibility
4. Reference Trust Property Control Act s9(1) for trustee duties

### 4.4 Timeline and Causation

**Key Timeline Points:**

- 6 June 2025: Daniel reports fraud to Bantjies
- 7 June 2025: Peter cancels all business cards (1 day after fraud report)
- 10 June 2025: Bantjies dismisses audit request ('going on holiday')
- 16 July 2025: R500,000 payment to Daniel
- 11 Aug 2025: Jax signs document backdating Peter as 'Main Trustee'
- 13 Aug 2025: Peter and Danie file interdict against Jax and Dan
- 24 Sep 2025: Interdict application filed

**Recommendations:**

1. Establish clear timeline showing card cancellation followed fraud report
2. Demonstrate venire contra factum proprium (Peter created documentation problem)
3. Show pattern of retaliation against fraud exposure
4. Link timeline to specific AD paragraph allegations

## 5. Specific Section Recommendations

### Section 7: Financial Irregularities

**Key Points:**

1. IT expenses (R6.738M/2024, R2.116M/2025) supported R34.9M revenue operations
2. Expenses represent 19% (2024) and 6% (2025) of revenue - reasonable for e-commerce
3. Card cancellation on 7 June 2025 rendered documentation inaccessible
4. Comprehensive reports provided to Bantjies on 6 June 2025

**Recommended Response Structure:**

- Acknowledge IT expenses exist
- Provide revenue context (R34.9M annual operations)
- Calculate expenses as % of revenue
- Explain card cancellation caused documentation access issues
- Reference fraud report submitted 6 June 2025
- Cite Annexure: fraud report, revenue statements

3. International subscriptions for global business operations
4. Documentation provided before card cancellation

### Section 9: Bantjies Debt

**Key Points:**

1. R18.685M debt creates irreconcilable conflict
2. Bantjies served as undisclosed trustee
3. Bantjies was accountant and Commissioner of Oaths
4. Conflict prevented impartial fraud investigation

**Recommended Citation:** Trust Property Control Act s9(1) - trustee duty to beneficiaries

### Section 10: Delinquency Allegations

**Key Points:**

1. Deny all delinquency allegations
2. Assert compliance with fiduciary duties
3. Demonstrate actions in best interests of companies
4. Reference Companies Act s76 - standards of conduct

### Section 11: Interdict Grounds

**Key Points:**

1. Applicant fails to establish clear right
2. No irreparable harm demonstrated
3. No urgency established
