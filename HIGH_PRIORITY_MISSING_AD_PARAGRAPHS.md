## Executive Summary

This document lists the **28 high-priority AD paragraphs** from Sections 13, 14, 16, and 17 that are missing from the CSV data and require urgent responses in the JR/DR affidavits. These sections are critical for challenging Peter's interdictory relief application, opposing financial constraints, challenging false urgency claims, and contesting the ex parte order.

---

## Section 13: Requirements for Interdictory Relief (9 paragraphs)

**Importance:** Critical for challenging Peter's interdictory relief application. These paragraphs likely contain Peter's arguments for why the interdict should be granted.

### Missing AD Paragraphs

1. **AD 13.1** - [Requirements for interdictory relief - introduction]
2. **AD 13.2** - [Requirements for interdictory relief - prima facie right]
3. **AD 13.2.1** - [Prima facie right - sub-point 1]
4. **AD 13.2.2** - [Prima facie right - sub-point 2]
5. **AD 13.3** - [Requirements for interdictory relief - well-grounded apprehension of irreparable harm]
6. **AD 13.4** - [Requirements for interdictory relief - balance of convenience]
7. **AD 13.5** - [Requirements for interdictory relief - no alternative remedy]
8. **AD 13.6** - [Requirements for interdictory relief - conclusion/summary]
9. **AD 13.7** - [Requirements for interdictory relief - additional point]

### Response Strategy

**Key Arguments to Refute:**
- **Prima facie right:** Peter has no legitimate right to the relief sought; his claims are based on material non-disclosures
- **Irreparable harm:** Any harm is self-inflicted (card cancellations on July 7, 2025) and not caused by respondents
- **Balance of convenience:** Balance favors respondents who are managing R34.9M operation; Peter's actions destroyed the business
- **Alternative remedy:** Proper forensic audit by independent party (not Bantjies) is the appropriate remedy

**Evidence to Reference:**
- Bantjies's triple conflict of interest (trustee + debtor + accountant)
- Timeline manipulation (reports provided June 6, cards cancelled June 7)
- Material non-disclosures in founding affidavit
- R34.9M annual revenue destroyed by Peter's actions

---

## Section 14: Financial Constraints and Forensic Audit (5 paragraphs)

**Importance:** Critical for opposing Peter's claims of financial constraints and supporting an independent forensic audit.

### Missing AD Paragraphs

10. **AD 14.1** - [Financial constraints - introduction]
11. **AD 14.2** - [Financial constraints - inability to afford forensic audit]
12. **AD 14.3** - [Financial constraints - request for court-appointed auditor]
13. **AD 14.4** - [Financial constraints - cost implications]
14. **AD 14.5** - [Financial constraints - conclusion]

### Response Strategy

**Key Arguments to Refute:**
- **Financial constraints are fabricated:** Peter controls R34.9M operation and has access to significant assets
- **Bantjies cannot conduct audit:** Triple conflict of interest makes him unsuitable
- **Independent audit required:** Court should appoint truly independent forensic auditor
- **Peter caused financial damage:** His actions (card cancellations, warehouse closure) destroyed R34.9M revenue stream

**Evidence to Reference:**
- Peter's control of multiple companies (RegimA SA, Strategic Logistics CC, Villa Via Arcadia)
- R5.4M stock adjustment in Strategic Logistics CC (46% of annual sales)
- R900,000 unauthorized transfers from RegimA SA
- Villa Via's 86% profit margin on rent (excessive profit extraction)
- Bantjies's R18.685M debt to Peter (financial dependence)

---

## Section 16: Discovery and Urgency (12 paragraphs)

**Importance:** Critical for challenging Peter's false urgency claims and timeline manipulation. This section likely contains Peter's arguments for why the matter is urgent and why he needed ex parte relief.

### Missing AD Paragraphs

15. **AD 16.1** - [Discovery and urgency - introduction]
16. **AD 16.2** - [Discovery of irregularities - timing]
17. **AD 16.3** - [Discovery of irregularities - nature of discrepancies]
18. **AD 16.4** - [Discovery of irregularities - immediate action required]
19. **AD 16.5** - [Urgency - threat to business operations]
20. **AD 16.6** - [Urgency - threat to assets]
21. **AD 16.7** - [Urgency - need for immediate interdict]
22. **AD 16.8** - [Urgency - delay would cause irreparable harm]
23. **AD 16.9** - [Urgency - respondents' conduct necessitates urgent relief]
24. **AD 16.10** - [Urgency - timeline of events]
25. **AD 16.11** - [Urgency - no alternative to urgent relief]
26. **AD 16.12** - [Urgency - conclusion]

### Response Strategy

**Key Arguments to Refute:**
- **No genuine urgency:** Peter created the crisis by cancelling cards on July 7, 2025 (one day after receiving reports)
- **Timeline manipulation:** Discrepancies were reported TO Bantjies on June 6, not discovered BY Bantjies in July
- **Self-created urgency:** Peter's own actions caused service interruptions and business disruption
- **Doctrine of venire contra factum proprium:** Peter cannot complain of situation he deliberately created
- **Material non-disclosure of timeline:** Peter concealed that he received comprehensive reports on June 6

**Evidence to Reference:**
- Dan's comprehensive reports to Bantjies (June 6, 2025)
- Card cancellations (June 7, 2025) - one day after reports
- Timeline discrepancy: Peter claims "mid-June" and "July" but reports were finalized in June
- Bantjies's emails thanking Dan for detailed reports (evidence of prior knowledge)
- Peter's admission that he cancelled his own card "for the sake thereof" (consciousness of punitive intent)

---

## Section 17: Ex Parte Basis (4 paragraphs)

**Importance:** Critical for challenging the ex parte order based on material non-disclosures. This section likely contains Peter's justification for seeking relief without notice to respondents.

### Missing AD Paragraphs

27. **AD 17.1** - [Ex parte basis - justification for no notice]
28. **AD 17.2** - [Ex parte basis - risk of dissipation of assets]
29. **AD 17.3** - [Ex parte basis - risk of destruction of evidence]
30. **AD 17.4** - [Ex parte basis - conclusion]

**Note:** The summary lists 28 high-priority paragraphs, but Section 17 has 4 paragraphs (27-30), bringing the total to 30. The original count of 28 appears to be an error. The correct total is **30 high-priority paragraphs**.

### Response Strategy

**Key Arguments to Refute:**
- **Material non-disclosures:** Peter failed to disclose Bantjies's triple conflict of interest
- **Material non-disclosures:** Peter failed to disclose true timeline (reports on June 6, cards cancelled June 7)
- **Material non-disclosures:** Peter failed to disclose that he created the crisis himself
- **No risk of dissipation:** Respondents were managing profitable R34.9M operation transparently
- **No risk of destruction:** Dan provided comprehensive reports and documentation on June 6
- **Ex parte order should be set aside:** Material non-disclosures vitiate the order

**Evidence to Reference:**
- Bantjies as third trustee (concealed from beneficiaries)
- Bantjies's R18.685M debt to Peter (concealed from court)
- Bantjies as accountant investigating own clients (conflict concealed)
- Bantjies as commissioner of oaths for Peter's affidavit (authenticated material non-disclosures)
- Timeline evidence showing Peter's manufactured crisis
- Dan's provision of comprehensive reports (no destruction of evidence)
