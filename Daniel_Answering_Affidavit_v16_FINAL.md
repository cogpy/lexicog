### SECTION 7: Discovery of Financial Irregularities

**DR 7.1** The Second Respondent disputes the allegations in AD 7.1. The IT expenses were legitimate business expenses necessary to support a complex e-commerce infrastructure generating R34.9 million in annual revenue across 51 Shopify stores. Mr. Bantjies was informed of these operations in detailed reports on 6 June 2025.

**DR 7.2** The Second Respondent disputes the allegations in AD 7.2. The characterization of payments as "irregular" is misleading. These were necessary operational expenses for maintaining global e-commerce operations, including Shopify subscriptions, cloud infrastructure, and payment processing systems required for R34.9M annual operations.

**DR 7.3** The Second Respondent disputes the allegations in AD 7.3. The IT expenses were proportional to revenue (approximately 19% in 2024, 6% in 2025) and necessary for maintaining 51 Shopify stores, 1100+ B2B salon tenants, and international e-commerce operations. Detailed documentation was provided to Mr. Bantjies on 6 June 2025.

**DR 7.4** The Second Respondent disputes the characterization of his conduct as 'increasingly erratic'. The Second Respondent's conduct has been professional and in the best interests of the companies. The Second Respondent reported fraud to Mr. Bantjies on 6 June 2025, one day before the Applicant cancelled all business cards.

**DR 7.5** The Second Respondent disputes that payments could not be explained. The Second Respondent provided comprehensive reports to Mr. Bantjies on 6 June 2025 documenting all IT expenses and exposing fraud in Villa Via operations. The Applicant cancelled all business cards on 7 June 2025, one day later, which rendered documentation systems inaccessible.

**DR 7.6** The Second Respondent disputes the allegations in AD 7.6. The R500,000 payment referenced was a legitimate business expense. The Applicant's cancellation of all business cards on 7 June 2025 (one day after the fraud report to Mr. Bantjies) rendered documentation systems inaccessible, creating the very "unexplained" situation now complained about.

**DR 7.7** The Second Respondent disputes the allegations in AD 7.7. The characterization of conduct as warranting "immediate intervention" is unfounded. The Second Respondent managed R34.9 million in annual operations professionally and successfully. The Applicant's "intervention" (card cancellations on 7 June 2025) was retaliatory, occurring one day after fraud was reported to Mr. Bantjies.

**DR 7.8** The Second Respondent denies adopting a 'superior position' or refusing to assist. The Second Respondent provided detailed reports and documentation. The characterization is unfounded and contradicted by the documentary evidence.

**DR 7.9** The Second Respondent disputes the allegations in AD 7.9. Communications with the Applicant were professional and appropriate. The characterization is contradicted by the documentary evidence, including the comprehensive fraud report provided to Mr. Bantjies on 6 June 2025.

**DR 7.10** The Second Respondent disputes the allegations in AD 7.10. The Second Respondent provided detailed documentation to Mr. Bantjies on 6 June 2025. The Applicant's cancellation of all business cards on 7 June 2025 was a retaliatory action that deliberately rendered documentation systems inaccessible.

**DR 7.11** The Second Respondent disputes the allegations in AD 7.11. The Second Respondent's conduct was professional and transparent. The allegation contradicts the fact that comprehensive fraud reports were provided to Mr. Bantjies on 6 June 2025, one day before the Applicant's retaliatory card cancellations.

**DR 7.12** The Second Respondent denies interfering with staff. The Second Respondent's actions were necessary to protect company systems and data following the discovery of fraud and unauthorized access to company accounts and systems by persons acting under the Applicant's direction.

**DR 7.13** The Second Respondent disputes the allegations in AD 7.13. IT infrastructure expenses were necessary for global e-commerce operations generating R34.9M annually. These included Shopify subscriptions for 51 stores, cloud hosting, payment processing, and software licenses - all standard costs for international e-commerce operations.

**DR 7.14** The Second Respondent disputes the allegations in AD 7.14. The expenses were legitimate operational costs, fully documented, and proportional to the revenue generated. The characterization as "unexplained" is misleading given that detailed documentation was provided to Mr. Bantjies on 6 June 2025.

**DR 7.15** The Second Respondent disputes the allegations in AD 7.15. The Second Respondent acted at all times in the best interests of the companies, maintaining operations that generated R34.9 million annually. The Applicant's actions (card cancellations, warehouse sabotage) were destructive, not protective.

**DR 7.16** The Second Respondent disputes the allegations in AD 7.16. The payments referenced were legitimate business expenses supporting e-commerce infrastructure. Documentation was provided to Mr. Bantjies on 6 June 2025. The Applicant's subsequent actions rendered further documentation inaccessible.

**DR 7.17** The Second Respondent disputes the allegations in AD 7.17. The Second Respondent's conduct was responsible and professional, managing complex international e-commerce operations successfully. The characterization is contradicted by the R34.9M in annual revenue generated.

**DR 7.18** The Second Respondent disputes the allegations in AD 7.18. Business decisions were made in the companies' best interests, focusing on revenue generation and operational sustainability. The R34.9M annual revenue demonstrates the success of these decisions.

**DR 7.19** The Second Respondent disputes the allegations in AD 7.19. The Applicant had access to financial information through Mr. Bantjies, who served as accountant. The Second Respondent provided additional detailed reports on 6 June 2025. The allegation of concealment is unfounded.

**DR 7.20** The Second Respondent disputes the allegations in AD 7.20. Compensation was reasonable and proportional to the responsibilities of managing R34.9M in annual operations across 51 Shopify stores and complex international e-commerce infrastructure.

### SECTION 8: IT Expenses Analysis

**DR 8.1** The Second Respondent disputes the characterization of IT expenses as 'unexplained'.
