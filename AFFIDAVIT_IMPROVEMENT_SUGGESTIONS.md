**Date:** November 4, 2025

## 1. Overview

This document provides a summary of key improvements and strategic suggestions for the answering affidavits of Jacqueline Faucitt (First Respondent) and Daniel Faucitt (Second Respondent). The refinements are designed to strengthen their legal position, enhance narrative coherence, and ensure that all claims are substantiated by evidence and proper legal citations.

## 2. Strategic Imperatives

The primary strategic goals for both affidavits are:

*   **Discharge the Ex Parte Order:** Demonstrate that the order was obtained through material non-disclosures and an abuse of process.
*   **Expose the False Narrative:** Systematically dismantle the Applicant’s allegations by presenting a counter-narrative grounded in evidence.
*   **Establish Oppressive Conduct:** Frame the Applicant’s actions as a pattern of oppressive and vexatious conduct designed to punish a whistleblower and seize control of the businesses.
*   **Shift the Focus to the True Malfeasance:** Divert the Court’s attention from the fabricated IT expense issue to the real financial irregularities (Villa Via, R5.4M stock adjustment, etc.).

## 3. Key Improvements for Jacqueline Faucitt’s Affidavit (v16)

### 3.1. Narrative and Tone

*   **Strengthened Opening:** The introduction now immediately frames the application as being based on material non-disclosures, setting an assertive and confident tone.
*   **Consistent Counter-Narrative:** Each response to the Applicant’s allegations is now tied back to the central theme of the Applicant’s oppressive conduct and the concealment of his agents’ fraud.
*   **Professional and Objective Language:** Removed placeholder text and ensured that all statements are framed in a manner appropriate for a court submission, avoiding speculation and focusing on facts.

### 3.2. Legal Argument

*   **Material Non-Disclosure:** The role of Mr. Bantjes as a conflicted, undisclosed trustee is now a central pillar of the legal argument. This is consistently raised as a reason for the discharge of the ex parte order.
*   **Oppressive Conduct:** The Applicant’s actions are explicitly framed as meeting the legal test for oppressive conduct under Section 163 of the Companies Act, providing a strong basis for a counter-application.
*   **Lack of Urgency:** The argument against urgency has been strengthened by highlighting the unexplained two-month delay and the principle of self-created urgency.
*   **Fiduciary Duties:** The affidavit now explicitly references the fiduciary duties of trustees and directors, and how the Applicant and his agents have breached them.

### 3.3. Evidence and Annexures

*   **Consistent Citations:** Placeholder annexure references have been replaced with specific, descriptive citations (e.g., “[JR-1.3, Trust Deed of Faucitt Family Trust]”). This creates a clear and verifiable link between the allegations and the supporting evidence.
*   **Integration of Key Evidence:** The affidavit now seamlessly integrates critical pieces of evidence, such as the Second Respondent’s 6 June 2025 report to Mr. Bantjes, the timeline of retaliatory actions, and the evidence of the true financial irregularities.

## 4. Key Improvements for Daniel Faucitt’s Affidavit (v10)

### 4.1. Narrative and Tone

*   **Assertive and Confident Voice:** The affidavit now projects the voice of a professional and diligent director who has been wrongly accused in retaliation for whistleblowing. The tone is firm, factual, and uncompromising.
*   **Whistleblower Framework:** The narrative consistently frames the Second Respondent as a whistleblower who acted in the best interests of the corporations, and the Applicant’s application as a SLAPP (Strategic Lawsuit Against Public Participation) suit.
*   **Focus on Retaliation:** The timeline of events is used to powerful effect, demonstrating the direct causal link between the Second Respondent’s fraud report on 6 June 2025 and the Applicant’s punitive actions on 7 June 2025.

### 4.2. Legal Argument

*   **Abuse of Process:** The affidavit now explicitly and repeatedly accuses the Applicant of abusing the court’s process, strengthening the case for a punitive costs order.
*   **Projection of Misconduct:** The argument is made that the Applicant’s allegations of delinquency are a projection of his own misconduct, and that it is the Applicant who should be facing a delinquency application.
*   **Material Non-Disclosure:** As with the First Respondent’s affidavit, the role of Mr. Bantjes is used to dismantle the foundation of the Applicant’s case.

### 4.3. Evidence and Annexures

*   **Critical Annexure Citations:** The affidavit now includes the crucial annexure citations that were previously missing, providing the evidentiary backbone for the counter-narrative. This includes the 6 June 2025 report, the timeline of events, and the evidence of the financial irregularities.
*   **Specificity and Detail:** The allegations are now supported by specific dates, figures, and document references, transforming them from general claims into a precise and compelling factual matrix.

## 5. General Recommendations

*   **Annexure Preparation:** It is imperative that all cited annexures are meticulously prepared, clearly labelled, and cross-referenced in the affidavits. The strength of the case rests on the quality and clarity of the evidence presented.
*   **Heads of Argument:** The legal arguments introduced in the affidavits (material non-disclosure, oppression, abuse of process) must be fully developed in the Heads of Argument, with comprehensive reference to case law and statutory provisions.
*   **Counter-Application:** Serious consideration should be given to filing a counter-application seeking relief for the Applicant’s oppressive conduct, including the appointment of an independent trustee and a full, independent forensic audit.
