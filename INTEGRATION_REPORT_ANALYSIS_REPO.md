## 3. Financial Fraud Details

### Villa Via Profit Extraction

- **Villa Via Monthly Rental:** R4.4M
- **Villa Via Net Profit:** R3.7M
- **Villa Via Profit Margin:** 84% (R3.7M / R4.4M)
- **Members Loan Extraction:** R22.8M
- **Rww Computer Platforms 2024:** R5.7M
- **Rww Expense Dumping:** Massive operational expenses for 51+ stores dumped on RWW
- **Accounting Sabotage:** All meaningful accounting ceased after July 2023
- **False Supplier Masking:** All transactions defaulted to "FNB" supplier to mask true expenses

### Analysis

Villa Via generated **R3.7M net profit** from **R4.4M monthly rental income**, representing an **84% profit margin**. This is consistent with the 86% profit margin previously identified. The members loan account of **R22.8M** indicates systematic capital extraction.

Meanwhile, RWW was burdened with **R5.7M in computer platform costs** (2024) to support the hidden empire of 51+ stores, with no corresponding revenue recognition.

## 4. Additional Conflicts of Interest

**Adderory (Rynette's son)**
- Conflict: Purchased regimaskin.co.za domain 14 days after Jax confrontation
- Timing: 2025-05-29
- Impact: Digital infrastructure control by family member of person with unauthorized financial control

**Rynette Farrar**
- Conflict: Unauthorized sole control of all financial accounts + son purchasing company domain
- Timing: June 2025 onwards
- Impact: Family network controlling both financial and digital infrastructure

### Family Network Control

The evidence reveals a **family network** (Rynette + son Adderory) controlling:
- All financial accounts (Rynette)
- Digital infrastructure (Adderory - regimaskin.co.za domain)
- Company operations (Rynette - unauthorized control since June 2025)

This represents a **coordinated takeover** of company assets and infrastructure.
