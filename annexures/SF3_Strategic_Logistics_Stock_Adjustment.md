# SF3: Strategic Logistics R5.4M Stock Adjustment

**Annexure Reference:** SF3  
**Subject:** R5.4 Million Stock "Disappeared" from Strategic Logistics  
**Relevance:** Evidence of systematic fraud and connection to Adderory stock supply

## Executive Summary

This annexure documents the disappearance of R5,400,000 worth of stock from Strategic Logistics (SLG), attributed to a "stock adjustment" indicating the stock had "just disappeared." This represents 46% of annual sales and is 10 times the historical stock adjustment rate. The same type of stock was supplied by Adderory (Rynette's son's company) to RegimA Skin Treatments, suggesting systematic fraud and transfer pricing manipulation.

## Key Evidence Required

### Stock Adjustment Documentation

**General Ledger Entries:**
Complete general ledger showing the R5.4M stock adjustment entry, including date, description, authorization, and account codes. The entry should show stock value being written off or adjusted without corresponding explanation or supporting documentation.

**Stock Reconciliation Reports:**
Physical stock count reports, perpetual inventory records, and reconciliation worksheets showing the discrepancy between book stock and physical stock. Evidence should demonstrate that stock valued at R5.4M was recorded in the system but could not be located physically.

**Audit Trail:**
Complete audit trail showing when the stock was received, how it was recorded, movements within the warehouse system, and the point at which it "disappeared." This should include purchase orders, goods received notes, stock movement records, and final adjustment entries.

**Authorization Records:**
Documentation showing who authorized the R5.4M stock adjustment, including approval signatures, justification memos, and any investigation reports into the missing stock.

### Historical Comparison Analysis

**Historical Stock Adjustment Rates:**
Analysis of stock adjustments for Strategic Logistics over previous years, demonstrating that normal adjustments were approximately 4.6% of sales (one-tenth of the 46% adjustment in question).

**Sales Volume Context:**
Strategic Logistics sales figures showing that R5.4M represents 46% of annual sales, an extraordinarily high proportion that cannot be explained by normal shrinkage, damage, or counting errors.

**Industry Benchmarks:**
Comparison to industry standard stock adjustment rates for similar logistics operations, demonstrating that 46% is far outside normal parameters and indicative of fraud rather than operational loss.

### Adderory Connection Evidence

**Stock Type Identification:**
Detailed description of the stock type that disappeared from Strategic Logistics, including product codes, descriptions, and specifications.

**Adderory Supply Records:**
Documentation showing Adderory (Rynette's son's company) supplied the same type of stock to RegimA Skin Treatments, including:
- Purchase orders from RegimA to Adderory
- Invoices from Adderory to RegimA
- Product specifications matching disappeared stock
- Delivery notes and goods received documentation

**Timeline Correlation:**
Timeline showing the relationship between stock disappearing from Strategic Logistics and stock being supplied by Adderory to RegimA Skin Treatments. Evidence of temporal proximity suggesting transfer rather than independent transactions.

**Pricing Analysis:**
Comparison of stock valuation in Strategic Logistics vs. pricing charged by Adderory to RegimA, potentially revealing markup and transfer pricing manipulation.

## Fraud Pattern Analysis

### Transfer Pricing Manipulation

The evidence suggests a systematic fraud scheme:

**Step 1: Stock Acquisition**
Strategic Logistics (controlled by Faucitt Family Trust) acquires stock at cost and records it in inventory at R5.4M value.

**Step 2: Physical Transfer**
Stock is physically removed from Strategic Logistics warehouse without proper documentation or authorization, creating a "disappearance."

**Step 3: Adderory Supply**
The same type of stock appears in Adderory's inventory and is supplied to RegimA Skin Treatments, likely at marked-up prices.

**Step 4: Accounting Manipulation**
Strategic Logistics writes off R5.4M as "stock adjustment," creating a loss in the trust-controlled entity while Adderory (Rynette's son's company) generates profit from selling the same stock.

**Result:**
Value is transferred from trust-controlled entities to Rynette's family (through her son's company), constituting fraud and breach of fiduciary duty.

### Systematic Nature

The R5.4M stock adjustment is not an isolated incident but part of a systematic pattern:

**R900,000 Unauthorized Transfers:**
Peter made unauthorized transfers of R900,000 from RegimA SA on February 14-15, 2025, without Daniel's authority as co-director.

**R1,035,000 Unpaid Debt:**
RegimA Skin Treatments owes R1,035,000 to Kayla's estate since February 2023, unpaid despite Rynette's false claim to Jacqui that it was paid.

**Villa Via 86% Profit Margin:**
Villa Via (trust-owned) charged 86% profit margin rent to group companies, extracting value from operating entities.

**Customer Diversion:**
Revenue diverted from RegimA operations to regimaskin.co.za (owned by Adderory), following domain registration on May 29, 2025.

**Pattern:**
Systematic extraction of value from trust and company assets, with benefits flowing to Bantjies, Rynette, and her family members.

## SARS Audit Context (Connection to SF4)

The R5.4M stock adjustment was among the amounts subject to SARS audit. In the SARS audit email (SF4), Rynette claimed that Bantjies instructed her to make substantial payments. This raises critical questions:

**Who Authorized the Stock Adjustment?**
If Rynette claimed Bantjies instructed payments, did Bantjies also instruct or approve the R5.4M stock write-off? This would demonstrate Bantjies's direct involvement in the fraud scheme.

**Why Was Stock Adjustment Not Investigated?**
A R5.4M loss (46% of sales) should have triggered immediate investigation by the accountant (Bantjies). The fact that it was simply written off as "stock adjustment" suggests Bantjies knew about and approved the fraud.

**Connection to Unallocated Expenses:**
The two years of unallocated expenses (dumped March 30, 2025) occurred while Bantjies was accountant and Rynette controlled the accounting system. The R5.4M stock adjustment may have been concealed within these unallocated expenses.

## Timeline of Stock Fraud

**Unknown Date:** R5.4M stock "disappears" from Strategic Logistics
- Stock physically removed from warehouse
- No proper documentation of removal
- Same stock type later supplied by Adderory

**Unknown Date:** Stock adjustment processed in accounting system
- R5.4M written off as "stock adjustment"
- Bantjies (as accountant) should have investigated but did not
- Rynette (controlling accounting system) processed the adjustment

**March 30, 2025:** Two years of unallocated expenses dumped
- May have included concealment of stock adjustment
- 12-hour deadline prevented proper analysis
- Daniel given insufficient time to discover fraud

**June 6, 2025:** Daniel exposes Villa Via fraud to Bantjies
- Daniel's analysis may have been approaching discovery of stock fraud
- Bantjies had motive to prevent further investigation
- Immediate retaliation followed

**June 10, 2025:** Bantjies dismisses Daniel's audit request
- Audit would have discovered R5.4M stock fraud
- Bantjies protected fraud scheme by blocking audit
- Four days after Daniel exposed Villa Via fraud

## Legal Implications

### Theft and Fraud

The disappearance of R5.4M in stock, combined with the same stock type being supplied by Adderory, constitutes prima facie evidence of theft and fraud. The stock did not "disappear" but was systematically transferred to benefit Rynette's family.

### Breach of Fiduciary Duty

Bantjies, as trustee and accountant, had duty to:
- Investigate extraordinary stock losses
- Protect trust assets
- Prevent fraud and theft
- Report suspicious transactions

The failure to investigate a R5.4M loss (46% of sales) demonstrates breach of fiduciary duty and suggests complicity in the fraud.

### Accounting Fraud

Recording a R5.4M stock loss as simple "stock adjustment" without investigation, supporting documentation, or proper authorization constitutes accounting fraud and manipulation of financial records.

### Transfer Pricing Fraud

If stock was transferred from Strategic Logistics to Adderory and then sold to RegimA at marked-up prices, this constitutes transfer pricing fraud designed to extract value from trust-controlled entities for the benefit of Rynette's family.

## Notes for Legal Team

This annexure demonstrates:

1. **Systematic fraud** involving R5.4M stock transfer
2. **Connection to Adderory** (Rynette's son's company) through same stock type
3. **Bantjies's complicity** in failing to investigate extraordinary loss
4. **Pattern of value extraction** from trust and company assets
5. **Motive for blocking audit** (would have discovered stock fraud)

The R5.4M stock adjustment is critical evidence of the systematic fraud that Jacqui and Daniel were investigating when they were retaliated against. Bantjies's dismissal of the audit request (June 10, 2025) takes on additional significance when understood as protecting this fraud scheme.

**Action Items:**
1. Obtain complete stock adjustment documentation from Strategic Logistics
2. Obtain historical stock adjustment rates for comparison
3. Obtain Adderory supply documentation showing same stock type
4. Prepare timeline correlating stock disappearance with Adderory supply
5. Obtain SARS audit documentation referencing the stock adjustment
6. Prepare transfer pricing analysis showing value extraction
7. Obtain witness statements from warehouse staff regarding stock movements
