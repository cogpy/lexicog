## Key Evidence Points

### System Control

**Rynette's Control:**
- Controlled Sage accounting system
- Used Peter's email address (pete@regima.com)
- Controlled all bank accounts
- Made all banking transactions daily
- Controlled email systems

**Peter's Lack of Access:**
- No access to his own email (pete@regima.com)
- Does not use computers
- Does not do banking
- No access to accounting systems
- Figurehead without actual control

### Chain of Command Revealed

**Actual Control Structure:**
- Bantjies → Rynette (not Peter → Rynette)
- Rynette claimed to act under Bantjies's instructions
- Peter had no operational authority
- Rynette controlled information flow

### Timeline Significance

**June 20, 2025:**
- Same date as customer diversion email instruction
- 14 days after Daniel exposed fraud to Bantjies (June 6)
- 13 days after Peter cancelled Daniel's cards (June 7)
- 10 days after Bantjies dismissed audit request (June 10)

**August 25, 2025:**
- 12 days after interdict granted (August 13)
- 14 days after Jacqui deceived into signing "Main Trustee" document (August 11)
- Demonstrates continued control despite interdict

## Impersonation Analysis

### Email Account Control

Rynette's use of pete@regima.com constitutes:
- **Impersonation:** Using Peter's identity for system access
- **Unauthorized Access:** Peter did not authorize or know about this use
- **System Manipulation:** Ability to create, modify, delete accounting records
- **Evidence Control:** Ability to conceal or reveal financial information

### Two Years of Unallocated Expenses

The Sage system screenshots are directly relevant to the question: **Why were expenses unallocated for two years?**

**Context:**
- Rynette controlled Sage system using pete@regima.com
- Linda (Rynette's sister) employed as bookkeeper
- Bantjies served as accountant
- Yet expenses remained unallocated for two years
- Dumped into RegimA Worldwide on March 30, 2025 with 12-hour deadline

**Implications:**
- Deliberate concealment rather than incompetence
- Rynette had ability to allocate but chose not to
- Bantjies had duty to supervise but failed to act
- Linda's role as bookkeeper raises questions about actual duties

## Legal Implications

### Fraud and Misrepresentation

**Impersonation:**
- Using another person's email identity without authorization
- Creating false impression of who is controlling systems
- Concealing actual chain of command

**System Manipulation:**
- Ability to create, modify, delete accounting records
- Control over what information is revealed or concealed
- Two years of unallocated expenses suggests deliberate concealment

### Peter's Founding Affidavit Undermined

Peter's affidavit claims he "discovered" financial irregularities, but:
- He had no access to Sage accounting system
- He had no access to his own email (pete@regima.com)
- Rynette controlled the systems using his email
- Peter could not have "discovered" anything without Rynette's cooperation

### Evidence Preservation

These screenshots are critical evidence because:
- Dated and timestamped proof of system access
- Visual confirmation of email address used
- Establishes pattern over time (June to August)
- Contradicts Peter's claims of control and discovery

## Notes

These Sage screenshots are smoking gun evidence that Peter was a figurehead without actual control. Rynette controlled the accounting system using Peter's email, which means:

1. **Peter could not have "discovered" irregularities** - he had no access to the systems
2. **Rynette controlled what was revealed** - she decided when to dump unallocated expenses
3. **Bantjies gave instructions to Rynette** - actual chain of command bypassed Peter
4. **The interdict was based on false premises** - Peter claimed control he never had

**Status:** Evidence collection in progress  
**Priority:** CRITICAL - Establishes Peter as figurehead and Rynette as actual controller
