# SF5: Adderory Company Registration and Stock Supply Documentation

**Annexure Reference:** SF5  
**Subject:** Adderory Company Registration and Stock Supply to RegimA  
**Relevance:** Demonstrates systematic diversion of business to Rynette's son's company

## Executive Summary

This annexure documents Adderory, the company owned by Rynette Farrar's son, which became a central beneficiary of the systematic fraud and business diversion scheme. Key evidence includes company registration, stock supply contracts to RegimA Skin Treatments, and the registration of the competing domain regimaskin.co.za on May 29, 2025 (14 days after Jacqui confronted Rynette about the R1,035,000 debt).

The evidence demonstrates that Adderory supplied the same type of stock that "disappeared" from Strategic Logistics (R5.4M), and that customers were systematically diverted from RegimA operations to the competing domain owned by Adderory.

## Systematic Diversion Scheme Analysis

### Timeline of Diversion

**May 15, 2025:** Jacqui confronts Rynette about R1,035,000 debt
- Confrontation triggers retaliation planning
- Rynette begins orchestrating business diversion

**May 22, 2025:** Shopify audit trail becomes unavailable (7 days later)
- Data expungement prevents tracking of customer and revenue information
- Prepares for customer database transfer

**May 29, 2025:** Domain regimaskin.co.za registered by Adderory (14 days later)
- Competing domain established
- RegimA branding and IP appropriated
- Infrastructure for customer diversion created

**June 20, 2025:** Email instructions to use new domain
- Customer communications redirected
- Database instructed to use regimaskin.co.za addresses
- Systematic diversion implemented

**Ongoing:** Revenue flows to Adderory instead of RegimA
- Customers diverted to competing business
- Value extracted from RegimA operations
- Benefits flow to Rynette's family

### Value Extraction Mechanism

The Adderory scheme represents systematic value extraction through multiple channels:

**Stock Supply:**
- Same stock type that disappeared from Strategic Logistics (R5.4M)
- Adderory supplies to RegimA at marked-up prices
- Value transferred from trust-controlled entities to Rynette's family

**Customer Diversion:**
- Customers built by Jacqui over 33 years
- Revenue diverted to competing domain owned by Adderory
- Ongoing extraction of business value

**IP Appropriation:**
- RegimA logo and branding used by regimaskin.co.za
- Intellectual property developed by Jacqui appropriated
- Brand value transferred to Rynette's family

## Connection to Control Structure

### Rynette's Orchestration

The Adderory scheme demonstrates Rynette's central role in orchestrating value extraction:

**Domain Registration:**
Rynette arranged for her son's company to register competing domain 14 days after Jacqui's confrontation, demonstrating retaliatory intent.

**Email Instructions:**
Rynette sent emails (using pete@regima.com or other controlled addresses) instructing staff to divert customers to the new domain.

**System Access:**
Rynette's control over email systems, accounting systems, and customer databases enabled the systematic diversion.

**IP Transfer:**
Rynette took RegimA logo and IP information and put it in her son's name, as stated in the narrative.

### Bantjies's Facilitation

Bantjies, as accountant and undisclosed trustee, facilitated the scheme by:

**Stock Adjustment Approval:**
Approving or failing to investigate the R5.4M stock adjustment that enabled stock transfer to Adderory.

**Financial System Control:**
Maintaining control over financial systems that concealed the value extraction.

**Audit Dismissal:**
Dismissing Daniel's audit request (June 10, 2025) that would have discovered the Adderory scheme.

## Legal Implications

### Theft and Fraud

The systematic diversion of stock, customers, and revenue to Adderory constitutes theft and fraud:
- Stock valued at R5.4M transferred to benefit Rynette's son
- Customer base built over 33 years appropriated
- Revenue diverted from legitimate business to competing entity

### Breach of Fiduciary Duty

Rynette, as administrator with access to trust and company assets, breached fiduciary duty by:
- Using position to benefit family members
- Diverting business opportunities to competing entity
- Appropriating intellectual property and customer relationships

### Intellectual Property Theft

Use of RegimA branding, logo, and IP by regimaskin.co.za without authorization constitutes intellectual property theft and trademark infringement.

### Unfair Competition

Establishing competing business using stolen customer data, appropriated IP, and diverted stock constitutes unfair competition and tortious interference with business relationships.

## Retaliation Pattern

The Adderory domain registration (May 29, 2025) fits the clear retaliation pattern:

**May 15, 2025:** Jacqui confronts Rynette (trigger event)
**May 22, 2025:** Shopify data expunged (7 days - first retaliation)
**May 29, 2025:** Competing domain registered (14 days - second retaliation)
**June 20, 2025:** Customer diversion implemented (36 days - ongoing retaliation)

This demonstrates that Jacqui was systematically punished for fulfilling her fiduciary duty as trustee by investigating the R1,035,000 debt.
