# SF2: Sage Screenshots (Rynette Using pete@regima.com)

**Annexure Reference:** SF2  
**Subject:** Evidence of Rynette Controlling Accounting System Using Peter's Email  
**Relevance:** Demonstrates control structure and Peter as figurehead, not actual controller

## Executive Summary

This annexure contains screenshots and system logs demonstrating that Rynette Farrar controlled the Sage accounting system using Peter's email address (pete@regima.com). This evidence establishes that Peter was a figurehead without actual control over financial systems, while Rynette operated with full administrative access using Peter's identity.

The evidence directly contradicts Peter's founding affidavit claims and demonstrates systematic impersonation and control manipulation.

## Key Evidence Required

### Sage System Screenshots

**User Login Records:**
Screenshots showing Rynette logged into Sage accounting system using pete@regima.com email address. Evidence should include timestamps, IP addresses, and session details demonstrating regular and consistent access.

**System Administration Logs:**
Screenshots of Sage system administration panels showing pete@regima.com account settings, permissions, and access levels. These logs should demonstrate that the account had full administrative privileges over all RegimA company accounts.

**Transaction Records:**
Screenshots of financial transactions processed through the pete@regima.com account, including journal entries, payment processing, and account reconciliations. Particular focus on the March 30, 2025 dumping of two years of unallocated expenses into RegimA Worldwide.

**Email Integration:**
Screenshots showing Sage system email notifications, password reset requests, and system alerts sent to pete@regima.com, with evidence that Rynette received and acted upon these communications.

### Email System Evidence

**Email Account Access:**
Evidence demonstrating Rynette's exclusive access to pete@regima.com email account, including login records, sent items, and email management activities.

**Email Correspondence:**
Copies of emails sent from pete@regima.com that were actually composed and sent by Rynette, demonstrating impersonation. Key examples include instructions regarding accounting matters, communications with banks, and correspondence with RegimA staff.

**System Configuration:**
Screenshots of email account settings showing Rynette configured as account administrator, with evidence of email forwarding rules, auto-responses, and other settings controlled by Rynette.

## Control Structure Analysis

### Peter's Lack of Access

The evidence should demonstrate that Peter Faucitt:

**No Computer Access:**
Peter does not use a computer and has no capability to access the Sage accounting system or pete@regima.com email account. This can be corroborated by witness statements and Peter's own admissions.

**No Banking Access:**
Peter does not do any banking and has no direct access to bank accounts. All banking transactions were processed by Rynette through the Sage system using pete@regima.com credentials.

**No System Knowledge:**
Peter lacks the technical knowledge to operate accounting software or manage email systems. All such operations were performed by Rynette.

### Rynette's Complete Control

The evidence demonstrates Rynette's exclusive control over:

**Accounting System:**
Full administrative access to Sage accounting for all RegimA companies, with ability to create, modify, and delete transactions without oversight or approval from Peter.

**Bank Accounts:**
Control over all bank account access through Sage integration, with ability to initiate transfers, process payments, and manage account reconciliations.

**Email Communications:**
Complete control over pete@regima.com email account, enabling Rynette to send instructions, make representations, and conduct business in Peter's name without his knowledge or authorization.

**Financial Records:**
Ability to manipulate financial records, allocate expenses, adjust entries, and control what information was visible to others, including Jacqui and Daniel.

- Rynette controlled accounting records showing debt status
- Confrontation triggered immediate retaliation

**May 22, 2025:** Shopify audit trail becomes unavailable (7 days after confrontation)

- Timeline suggests retaliatory action

**June 6, 2025:** Daniel exposes Villa Via fraud to Bantjies

- Exposure triggered immediate retaliation

**June 7, 2025:** 15 company cards cancelled (1 day after fraud exposure)

## Impersonation Evidence

### Email Instructions

Examples of emails sent from pete@regima.com that were actually composed and sent by Rynette:

**To RegimA Staff:**
Instructions regarding accounting procedures, expense allocations, and system access. These emails demonstrate knowledge and technical capability that Peter does not possess.

**To Banks:**
Communications with banking institutions regarding account access, transaction authorization, and account management. Evidence that Rynette conducted all banking correspondence in Peter's name.

**To Vendors and Suppliers:**
Business correspondence regarding payments, contracts, and commercial arrangements. Demonstrates Rynette's operational control over business relationships.

### System Instructions

Evidence of Rynette instructing system changes and configurations:

**Sage System Changes:**
Documentation of accounting system modifications, user access changes, and configuration updates executed through pete@regima.com account by Rynette.

**Email System Cancellations:**
Evidence that Rynette cancelled regima.zone email addresses and redirected communications to regimaskin.co.za (owned by her son Adderory), all while using Peter's identity.

**Shopify System Cancellations:**
Instructions to cancel Shopify systems and automation tools, sent from pete@regima.com but actually executed by Rynette.

## Connection to SF4 (SARS Audit Email)

The SF2 evidence directly supports SF4, where Rynette claimed that Bantjies instructed her to make substantial payments. This claim reveals the actual chain of command:

**Not Peter → Rynette**, but rather **Bantjies → Rynette**

This demonstrates that Rynette took instructions from Bantjies, not Peter, despite using Peter's email identity. The control structure was:

1. Bantjies (undisclosed trustee and R18.685M debtor) provided instructions
2. Rynette executed instructions using pete@regima.com identity
3. Peter had no knowledge or control over these actions

## Legal Implications

### Impersonation and Fraud

Rynette's use of pete@regima.com to conduct business, send instructions, and make representations constitutes impersonation. When combined with financial transactions and business decisions, this rises to the level of fraud.

### False Affidavit Claims

Peter's founding affidavit makes claims about financial management and decision-making that are contradicted by the evidence of Rynette's exclusive control. Peter could not have made informed decisions about matters he had no access to or knowledge of.

### Abuse of Process

The interdict application was based on Peter's claimed need to protect trust and company assets. However, the evidence demonstrates Peter had no actual control over these assets, and the real controllers (Bantjies and Rynette) were the ones engaging in misconduct.
