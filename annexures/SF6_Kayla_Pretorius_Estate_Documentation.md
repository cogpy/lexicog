# SF6: Kayla Pretorius Estate Documentation (R1,035,000 Debt)

**Annexure Reference:** SF6  
**Subject:** R1,035,000 Debt Owed to Kayla Pretorius Estate Since February 2023  
**Relevance:** Demonstrates "profiting from proceeds of murder" and trigger for retaliation against Jacqui

## Executive Summary

This annexure documents the R1,035,000 debt owed by RegimA Skin Treatments to the estate of Kayla Pretorius since February 2023. Kayla was murdered on July 13, 2023, and the debt has remained unpaid despite Rynette's false statement to Jacqui that it was paid. On May 15, 2025, Jacqui confronted Rynette about this debt, stating it constituted "profiting from proceeds of murder." This confrontation triggered immediate retaliation against Jacqui, including data expungement (7 days later) and domain registration for competing business (14 days later).

## "Profiting from Proceeds of Murder" Analysis

### Moral and Legal Implications

Jacqui's characterization of the unpaid debt as "profiting from proceeds of murder" carries significant moral and legal weight:

**Unjust Enrichment:**
RegimA Skin Treatments has had use of R1,035,000 for over two years without payment, while Kayla's estate and beneficiaries have been deprived of these funds.

**Exploitation of Death:**
The debt became more difficult to collect after Kayla's murder, and there appears to have been deliberate avoidance of payment following her death.

**Estate Deprivation:**
Kayla's estate beneficiaries (likely including her children or family) have been deprived of R1,035,000 that rightfully belongs to the estate.

**Fiduciary Breach:**
As trustee, Jacqui had duty to ensure trust-controlled companies paid legitimate debts. The failure to pay Kayla's estate while Kayla was alive and especially after her murder constitutes breach of fiduciary duty by those controlling the company.

### Rynette's Control and Responsibility

Rynette, as controller of all bank accounts and accounting systems, had the power to pay the debt but chose not to:

**Control Over Payments:**
Rynette controlled all banking transactions and could have authorized payment at any time.

**False Statement:**
Rynette's false claim that the debt was paid demonstrates consciousness of guilt and intent to deceive Jacqui.

**Continued Non-Payment:**
Even after Jacqui's confrontation (May 15, 2025), the debt has remained unpaid, demonstrating deliberate refusal rather than oversight.

## Retaliation Timeline

Jacqui's May 15, 2025 confrontation about the debt triggered immediate and systematic retaliation:

### May 15, 2025: The Confrontation

Jacqui confronted Rynette about the R1,035,000 debt owed to Kayla's estate. Jacqui stated this was "profiting from proceeds of murder." Rynette had falsely claimed the debt was paid.

**Significance:**
- Jacqui fulfilled fiduciary duty as trustee by investigating unpaid debt
- Confrontation exposed Rynette's false statement
- Confrontation threatened to expose broader fraud and control structure

### May 22, 2025: First Retaliation (7 Days Later)

Shopify audit trail became unavailable, preventing tracking of customer data, revenue streams, and business operations.

**Retaliatory Nature:**
- Occurred exactly 7 days after confrontation
- Prevented Jacqui from further investigation
- Destroyed evidence of business operations Daniel and Kayla built

### May 29, 2025: Second Retaliation (14 Days Later)

Domain regimaskin.co.za registered by Adderory (Rynette's son), establishing competing business to divert customers and revenue.

**Retaliatory Nature:**
- Occurred exactly 14 days after confrontation
- Appropriated RegimA IP and branding
- Diverted business Jacqui built over 33 years

### June 20, 2025: Third Retaliation (36 Days Later)

Email instructions sent to RegimA database to use regimaskin.co.za addresses instead of regima.zone, implementing systematic customer diversion.

**Retaliatory Nature:**
- Operationalized the competing domain
- Diverted customers and revenue to Rynette's son's company
- Punished Jacqui by destroying business she built

### August 11, 2025: Fourth Retaliation (88 Days Later)

Jacqui deceived into signing "Main Trustee" document, backdated to July 1, 2025.

**Retaliatory Nature:**
- Deceptive document signing
- Set up legal basis for interdict
- Manipulated Jacqui's trustee status

### August 13, 2025: Fifth Retaliation (90 Days Later)

Interdict granted against Jacqui (and Daniel), excluding them from companies and trust operations.

**Retaliatory Nature:**
- Occurred 2 days after document signing
- Removed Jacqui from oversight position
- Punished her for investigating debt and exposing fraud
- Prevented further investigation of unpaid debt and other fraud

## Pattern: Punishment for Fulfilling Fiduciary Duty

The retaliation timeline demonstrates that Jacqui was systematically punished for fulfilling her fiduciary duty as trustee:

**Duty Fulfilled:**
Jacqui investigated unpaid debt to Kayla's estate, as required by her fiduciary duty to ensure proper management of trust-controlled company assets and liabilities.

**Immediate Punishment:**
Within 7 days of the confrontation, retaliation began with data expungement.

**Systematic Destruction:**
Over the following 90 days, Jacqui's business was systematically destroyed through customer diversion, IP theft, and ultimately legal exclusion via interdict.

**Message Sent:**
The retaliation pattern sends clear message: beneficiaries who investigate fraud will be punished and excluded.

## Connection to Broader Fraud Pattern

The unpaid debt to Kayla's estate is part of a broader pattern of financial misconduct:

**R900,000 Unauthorized Transfers:**
Peter made unauthorized transfers without Daniel's authority (February 14-15, 2025).

**R5.4M Stock Disappeared:**
Strategic Logistics stock "disappeared" and same type supplied by Adderory.

**Villa Via 86% Profit Margin:**
Trust-owned entity extracted excessive rent from operating companies.

**Two Years Unallocated Expenses:**
Systematic accounting manipulation while Rynette controlled systems.

**Pattern:**
Systematic extraction of value from trust and company assets, with legitimate creditors (like Kayla's estate) left unpaid while insiders benefited.

## Legal Implications

### Breach of Fiduciary Duty

Failure to pay legitimate R1,035,000 debt while trust and company funds were used for other purposes constitutes breach of fiduciary duty by those controlling the entities.

### Fraudulent Misrepresentation

Rynette's false statement that the debt was paid constitutes fraudulent misrepresentation intended to deceive Jacqui and prevent investigation.

### Retaliation Against Trustee

The systematic retaliation against Jacqui for investigating the debt constitutes abuse of process and demonstrates that the interdict was not about protecting assets but about punishing investigation.

### Estate Claim

Kayla's estate has legitimate claim for R1,035,000 plus interest from February 2023, and the estate may have additional claims for damages resulting from deliberate non-payment.
