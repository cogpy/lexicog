- Analysis of ethical breach in certifying document that benefits creditor (the trust)

## Conflict of Interest Analysis

### Triple Conflict Structure

Bantjies occupied three conflicting positions simultaneously:

**As Trustee:**
- Fiduciary duty to maximize trust assets
- Duty to collect debts owed to the trust
- Duty to act in beneficiaries' best interests

**As Debtor:**
- Personal interest in avoiding debt collection
- Personal interest in preventing trust from discovering fraud
- Personal interest in maintaining control over trust finances

**As Accountant:**
- Professional duty to provide accurate financial information
- Control over financial systems and records
- Ability to manipulate or conceal financial information

### Motive to Prevent Discovery

The R18.685M debt provides clear motive for Bantjies to:

1. **Dismiss Daniel's audit request** (June 10, 2025, 4 days after fraud exposure)
   - Audit would likely discover the debt
   - Audit would reveal conflicts of interest
   - Audit would expose control structure

2. **Support Peter's interdict application**
   - Remove Daniel and Jacqui from oversight positions
   - Prevent further investigation
   - Maintain control over financial systems

3. **Certify Peter's affidavit despite material omissions**
   - Affidavit omitted Bantjies's trustee status
   - Affidavit omitted Bantjies's R18.685M debt
   - Certification gave false legitimacy to deceptive application

## Timeline of Relevant Events

**June 6, 2025:** Daniel exposes Villa Via fraud to Bantjies (unknowingly reporting to perpetrator)

**June 10, 2025:** Bantjies dismisses Daniel's audit request (4 days after fraud exposure)
- Bantjies had R18.685M reasons to prevent audit
- Audit would discover debt and conflicts
- Dismissal protected Bantjies's interests, not trust's interests

**August 2025:** Bantjies certifies Peter's founding affidavit as Commissioner of Oaths
- Affidavit omitted Bantjies's undisclosed trustee status
- Affidavit omitted Bantjies's R18.685M debt
- Certification while being conflicted party constitutes ethical breach

**August 13, 2025:** Interdict granted against Jacqui and Daniel
- Removed oversight by beneficiaries who were investigating fraud
- Protected Bantjies's position and debt from scrutiny
- Maintained control structure that concealed conflicts

## Legal Implications

### Breach of Fiduciary Duty

As trustee, Bantjies had duty to:
- Disclose conflicts of interest
- Act in beneficiaries' best interests
- Support legitimate investigations of fraud
- Not use position for personal benefit

The R18.685M debt demonstrates Bantjies acted in personal interest, not trust's interest.

### Commissioner of Oaths Misconduct

Certifying an affidavit that:
- Omits certifier's own undisclosed trustee status
- Omits certifier's own substantial debt to the trust
- Contains material non-disclosures benefiting the certifier

This constitutes professional misconduct and abuse of Commissioner of Oaths authority.

### Fraud Facilitation

The debt provides motive for Bantjies to:
- Conceal fraud from beneficiaries
- Dismiss legitimate audit requests
- Support retaliatory legal action against investigators
- Maintain control over financial systems to prevent discovery
