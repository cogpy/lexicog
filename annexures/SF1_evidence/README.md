### Conflict of Interest

Bantjies occupies four conflicting roles:

1. **Trustee** - Undisclosed trustee of Faucitt Family Trust
2. **Debtor** - Owes R18.685M to the trust
3. **Accountant** - Accountant for all RegimA companies (Bantjes and Company)
4. **Commissioner of Oaths** - Certified Peter's founding affidavit

### Evidence of Conflict in Action

**Timeline:**
- June 6, 2025: Daniel exposes Villa Via fraud to Bantjies
- June 10, 2025: Bantjies dismisses Daniel's audit request ("going on holiday")
- **Analysis:** Bantjies had direct financial interest in preventing discovery of fraud

- INTEGRATED_NARRATIVE_FRAMEWORK.md (extensive references throughout)

## Legal Implications

### Trust Property Control Act Section 9(1)
Trustees must act with care, diligence, and skill in the interests of beneficiaries. Bantjies's position as both trustee and debtor creates impermissible conflict.

### Professional Misconduct
As professional accountant, Bantjies had duty to:
- Ensure accurate accounting records
- Investigate financial irregularities
- Maintain independence and objectivity
- Avoid conflicts of interest

### Commissioner of Oaths Conflict
Bantjies certified Peter's founding affidavit despite:
- Being undisclosed trustee
- Owing R18.685M to the trust
- Having received Daniel's fraud report
- Having dismissed Daniel's audit request

## Action Items for Legal Team

1. ✓ Obtain debt documentation from trust records
2. ✓ Obtain payout schedule (May 2026, 2027, 2029)
3. ⚠ Obtain evidence of undisclosed trustee appointment
4. ⚠ Obtain Commissioner of Oaths certification records
5. ⚠ Obtain email from Daniel to Bantjies (June 6, 2025) exposing fraud
6. ⚠ Obtain email from Bantjies (June 10, 2025) dismissing audit request
7. ⚠ Obtain trust loan agreement
8. ⚠ Obtain evidence of Bantjies's instructions to Rynette
9. ⚠ Prepare legal analysis of conflict under Trust Property Control Act
10. ⚠ Prepare professional misconduct complaint to accounting body

## Notes

This evidence demonstrates Bantjies's fundamental conflict of interest that undermines the credibility of Peter's founding affidavit and the entire interdict application. The R18.685M debt created direct financial motive to prevent discovery of fraud that Daniel reported on June 6, 2025.

**Status:** Evidence collection in progress
