## Summary of Key Legal Issues

### 1. Conflict of Interest (Bantjies)
**Issue:** Danie Bantjies served as undisclosed trustee, debtor (R18.685M), accountant, company controller, and Commissioner of Oaths for Applicant's affidavit.

**Legal Breach:** Trust Property Control Act s9(1) - duty to act in beneficiaries' interests

**Impact:** Unable to impartially investigate fraud reported by beneficiary Daniel

### 2. Venire Contra Factum Proprium
**Issue:** Peter cancelled cards on 7 June 2025 (one day after fraud report), rendering documentation inaccessible, then complained about missing documentation.

**Legal Principle:** Cannot complain about consequences of own actions

**Impact:** Undermines credibility of allegations regarding unexplained expenses

### 3. Material Non-Disclosure
**Issue:** Applicant failed to disclose Bantjies as third trustee and R18.685M debtor

**Impact:** Invalidates claim of impartial investigation and creates appearance of bias

### 4. Fiduciary Breach
**Issue:** Peter, as trustee, attacked beneficiaries Jax and Dan using trust-owned companies

**Legal Breach:** Trust Property Control Act s9(1) - trustee duty to beneficiaries

**Impact:** Demonstrates misuse of trust powers for personal vendetta
