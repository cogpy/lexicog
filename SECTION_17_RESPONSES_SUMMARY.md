## Section 17: Ex Parte Basis Overview

Section 17 contains Peter's justification for bringing the application on an ex parte basis (without notice to the respondents). This section is **critical** because:

1. **Challenges the Order's Validity:** If the ex parte order was obtained through material non-disclosures, it can be set aside
2. **Exposes Abuse of Process:** Demonstrates that Peter manufactured urgency to justify ex parte relief
3. **Establishes Bad Faith:** Shows Peter breached his duty of *uberrima fides* (utmost good faith) to the Court
4. **Foundation for Counter-Application:** Provides grounds to set aside the ex parte order

## AD 17.1: Fear of Misappropriation

### Peter's Allegation

Peter claims he fears the respondents will "misappropriate further sums of money" as a "knee jerk reaction" to service of the application, citing Jacqueline's transfer of R500,000.00 to Daniel as evidence of "defiant" conduct.

### JR 17.1 Response Strategy

**Core Argument:** Peter's fear is self-serving and based on material non-disclosure.

**Key Points:**
1. **R500,000 transfer was legitimate:** Necessary operational payment for R34.9M e-commerce operation
2. **Peter created the crisis:** Cancelled 15 credit cards on June 7, 2025, crippling business operations
3. **Timeline manipulation:** Dan provided reports to Bantjies on June 6; cards cancelled June 7
4. **Doctrine of venire contra factum proprium:** Peter cannot benefit from predicament of his own making

**Material Non-Disclosure:** Peter omitted that the transfer was necessitated by his own card cancellations.

### DR 17.1 Response Strategy

**Core Argument:** Factual corroboration with specific evidence.

**Key Points:**
1. **Operational necessity:** R500,000 covered international suppliers, software subscriptions, hosting for 51 stores
2. **Timeline evidence:** Reports delivered June 6 (**Annexure DF4**); cards cancelled June 7
3. **Inversion of truth:** Peter's card cancellation was the actual "knee jerk reaction"
4. **Self-serving narrative:** Peter's fear conceals his own retaliatory conduct

**Evidence Referenced:** Annexure DF4 (card cancellation documentation)

---

## AD 17.2: Anton Piller-Style Order

### Peter's Allegation

Peter requests an Anton Piller-style order, claiming he has "reason to believe" the respondents will "conceal or destroy relevant documentation" if not subject to an appropriate order.

### JR 17.2 Response Strategy

**Core Argument:** Peter's claim is baseless and contradicted by facts.

**Key Points:**
1. **Dan provided comprehensive reports:** On June 6, 2025, Dan gave Bantjies detailed financial reports and evidence
2. **Respondents preserved evidence:** Dan has been the party providing information, not concealing it
3. **Punitive tactic:** Request is not to preserve evidence but to harass respondents and seize business control
4. **Evidence exposes misconduct:** Respondents have vested interest in preserving documentation

**Material Non-Disclosure:** Peter omitted that Dan voluntarily provided comprehensive documentation.

### DR 17.2 Response Strategy

**Core Argument:** Dan's conduct proves transparency and commitment to evidence preservation.

**Key Points:**
1. **Compiled and preserved evidence:** Dan meticulously archived all financial data, communications, system logs
2. **Provided comprehensive reports:** On June 6, 2025, delivered detailed reports, spreadsheets, supporting documents
3. **Hostile tactic:** True purpose is to seize evidence Dan compiled against Peter and associates
4. **Whistleblower protection:** Dan has vested interest in documentation that will vindicate him

**Evidence Referenced:** Reports provided to Bantjies on June 6, 2025

## AD 17.3: Ex Parte Basis Justification

### Peter's Allegation

Peter states that "such applications are usually brought, with respect, on an ex parte basis, for obvious reasons."

### JR 17.3 Response Strategy

**Core Argument:** Peter breached duty of *uberrima fides* through material non-disclosures.

**Key Points:**
1. **Duty of utmost good faith:** Ex parte applicants held to highest standard; Peter failed
2. **Material non-disclosures include:**
   - **Bantjies's triple conflict:** Trustee + Debtor (R18.685M) + Accountant + Commissioner of Oaths
   - **False timeline:** Peter concealed that Dan reported misconduct June 6; cards cancelled June 7
   - **Self-created urgency:** Peter sabotaged companies' financial operations
3. **Unclean hands:** Peter approached Court with concealed material facts
4. **Protecting himself, not companies:** Peter protecting himself from evidence respondents compiled

**Material Non-Disclosures:**
- Bantjies is co-Trustee of Faucitt Family Trust
- Bantjies owes Peter R18.685 million
- Bantjies was Commissioner of Oaths for Peter's affidavit
- Dan provided reports June 6; cards cancelled June 7

### DR 17.3 Response Strategy

**Core Argument:** Underscore extent of material non-disclosures.

**Key Points:**
1. **Bantjies hopelessly conflicted:**
   - Co-Trustee alongside Peter
   - Personal debtor owing R18.685M (**Annexure SF1**)
   - Commissioner of Oaths for Peter's founding affidavit (fundamental breach)
2. **False timeline presented:** Peter concealed possession of Dan's reports from June 6
3. **Manufactured urgency:** Created false impression of recent discovery in July
4. **Profound misrepresentations:** Go to heart of matter; fundamental breach of *uberrima fides*

**Evidence Referenced:** Annexure SF1 (Bantjies's R18.685M debt)

---

## AD 17.4: Urgency Justification

### Peter's Allegation

Peter states the matter is "sufficiently urgent to compel the attention of the above Honourable Court ex parte, on an urgent basis."

### JR 17.4 Response Strategy

**Core Argument:** Urgency is fabricated; crisis was self-created.

**Key Points:**
1. **Self-created urgency:** Disruption caused by Peter's card cancellations on June 7
2. **Sabotage timing:** One day after receiving detailed reports of financial misconduct
3. **True motive:** Pre-emptive strike to prevent respondents from taking action on fraud uncovered
4. **Abuse of process:** Application is sword to attack whistleblowers, not shield to protect companies
5. **Order must be set aside:** Obtained through material non-disclosures and false narrative

**Material Non-Disclosure:** Peter omitted that he created the crisis by cancelling cards.

### DR 17.4 Response Strategy

**Core Argument:** Evidence demonstrates crisis was entirely self-created.

**Key Points:**
1. **No urgency before June 7:** E-commerce businesses functioning profitably, generating R34.9M annually
2. **Urgency arose from card cancellations:** Single act on June 7 crippled companies' ability to pay for essential services
3. **Irrefutable timeline:**
   - June 6: Dan delivered reports exposing misconduct
   - June 7: Peter retaliated by sabotaging financial infrastructure
   - Peter then cited chaos he engineered as basis for urgent relief
4. **Flagrant abuse:** Peter had ample opportunity for ordinary legal channels
5. **Manufactured crisis:** Designed to justify ex parte application to dispossess respondents

**Evidence:** Timeline of June 6 reports and June 7 card cancellations

## Key Legal Strategies Employed

### 1. Material Non-Disclosures Strategy

**Principle:** Applicants seeking ex parte relief must disclose all material facts with utmost good faith (*uberrima fides*).

**Application:**
- **Bantjies's Conflicts:** Peter failed to disclose that his key witness is hopelessly conflicted (Trustee + Debtor + Accountant + Commissioner)
- **Timeline Manipulation:** Peter concealed that Dan provided reports June 6; cards cancelled June 7
- **Self-Created Urgency:** Peter omitted that he manufactured the crisis through card cancellations

**Legal Consequence:** Ex parte order obtained through material non-disclosures can be set aside.

### 2. Doctrine of Venire Contra Factum Proprium

**Principle:** A party cannot benefit from a situation of their own making (estoppel).

**Application:**
- Peter cancelled cards June 7, creating operational crisis
- Peter then cited crisis as basis for urgent ex parte relief
- Peter cannot complain of situation he deliberately created

**Legal Consequence:** Peter's claim of urgency is invalid.

### 3. Inversion of Narrative

**Principle:** Expose how Peter's allegations are projections of his own conduct.

**Application:**
- Peter accuses respondents of "knee jerk reaction" → Peter's card cancellation was actual knee jerk reaction
- Peter fears "misappropriation" → Peter's own actions sabotaged R34.9M operation
- Peter claims risk of "destruction of evidence" → Dan provided comprehensive evidence

**Legal Consequence:** Reveals Peter's bad faith and tactical manipulation.

### 4. Complementary Affidavit Strategy

**Principle:** JR and DR responses should be coherent individually but create synergistic realization of truth when read together.

**Application:**
- **JR responses:** Focus on legal arguments, material non-disclosures, and principles
- **DR responses:** Provide factual corroboration, specific evidence, and timeline details
- **Together:** Create complete picture that exposes Peter's abuse of process

**Legal Consequence:** Strengthens credibility and persuasiveness of response.

## Legal Principles Applied

### 1. Uberrima Fides (Utmost Good Faith)

**Definition:** Applicants seeking ex parte relief must disclose all material facts with utmost good faith.

**Application:** Peter breached this duty by concealing:
- Bantjies's conflicts of interest
- True timeline of events
- Self-created nature of urgency

**Authority:** *Herbstein and Van Winsen: The Civil Practice of the High Courts of South Africa* (5th ed)

### 2. Venire Contra Factum Proprium (Estoppel)

**Definition:** A party cannot benefit from a situation of their own making.

**Application:** Peter created crisis by cancelling cards, then cited crisis as basis for urgent relief.

**Authority:** South African common law principle of estoppel

### 3. Material Non-Disclosure

**Definition:** Failure to disclose facts that would have influenced the court's decision.

**Application:** Peter's non-disclosures go to heart of matter:
- Bantjies's R18.685M debt creates financial dependence
- Bantjies as Trustee creates irreconcilable conflict
- Timeline manipulation conceals retaliatory motive

**Consequence:** Ex parte order can be set aside.

## Conclusion

The Section 17 responses successfully expose Peter's abuse of the ex parte process through a systematic dismantling of his justifications. The responses reveal material non-disclosures, timeline manipulation, and self-created urgency, providing strong grounds to set aside the ex parte order.

The complementary strategy employed—with JR responses focusing on legal principles and DR responses providing factual corroboration—creates a powerful synergistic effect that gradually reveals the truth without making overt accusations.

The coverage increase from 45.4% to 48.2% represents significant progress, with 68 of 141 paragraphs now addressed. The remaining 26 high-priority paragraphs (Sections 13, 14, 16) should be completed next to achieve comprehensive coverage of all critical sections.
