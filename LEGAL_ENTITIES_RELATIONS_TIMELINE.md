## 5. KEY RELATIONSHIPS & CONFLICTS

### 5.1 Bantjies Conflict of Interest

Danie Jacobus Bantjies occupies four conflicting roles:

1. **Trustee** of Faucitt Family Trust (undisclosed to beneficiaries)
2. **Debtor** owing R18.685M to the trust
3. **Accountant** for all companies (Bantjes and Company)
4. **Company Controller** giving instructions to Rynette for multi-million rand transactions

**Legal Issue:** This creates an impermissible conflict under Trust Property Control Act Section 9(1) and Companies Act fiduciary duties.

### 5.2 Rynette Control Structure

Rynette Farrar controls:

- All bank accounts (Peter had no access)
- Sage accounting system using Peter's email (pete@regima.com)
- Claims to act under Bantjies's instructions, not Peter's

**Family Connection:** Sister Linda employed as bookkeeper, yet 2 years expenses unallocated until 30 March 2025

**Son's Company:** Adderory (Pty) Ltd supplies stock to RegimA Skin Treatments and registered competing domain regimaskin.co.za

### 5.3 Revenue Diversion Pattern

Systematic sabotage timeline:

1. **15 May 2025:** Jax confronts Rynette about R1.035M debt
2. **22 May 2025:** Shopify data expunged (7 days later)
3. **29 May 2025:** Competing domain registered (14 days later)
4. **6 June 2025:** Dan exposes Villa Via fraud to Bantjies
5. **7 June 2025:** Peter cancels cards (1 day later)
6. **20 June 2025:** Customer diversion email sent
7. **8 July 2025:** Warehouse sabotage

**Pattern:** Each sabotage action follows either Jax's debt inquiry or Dan's fraud exposure.

### 5.4 Venire Contra Factum Proprium

Peter's actions demonstrate acting contrary to his own previous conduct:

- Cancelled cards on 7 June 2025 (one day after Dan's cooperation)
- Card cancellation rendered documentation inaccessible (card-based authentication)
- Then complained about missing documentation
- Created the problem he now complains about in the interdict application
