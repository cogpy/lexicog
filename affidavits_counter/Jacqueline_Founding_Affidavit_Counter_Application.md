**FOUNDING AFFIDAVIT OF JACQUELINE FAUCITT IN THE COUNTER-APPLICATION**

---

I, the undersigned,

**JACQUELINE FAUCITT**

do hereby make oath and say that:

1.  I am an adult female and the First Respondent in the main application. I am also the mother of the Second Respondent, Daniel Faucitt (Daniel), and the wife of the Applicant, Peter Faucitt (Peter).

2.  The facts contained in this affidavit are within my personal knowledge, unless the context indicates otherwise, and are to the best of my belief both true and correct.

3.  This affidavit is filed in support of the Counter-Application brought by myself and Daniel against Peter, in which we seek, *inter alia*, an order declaring Peter a delinquent director in terms of Section 162(5) of the Companies Act 71 of 2008.

## **PART A: SETTING ASIDE THE EX PARTE ORDER**

4.  On [Date of Order], Peter obtained an ex parte order against myself and Daniel. This order was obtained through a gross abuse of the court process, founded on material non-disclosures and a manufactured sense of urgency.

5.  Peter's application was not brought in good faith. He failed to disclose to this Honourable Court several material facts, the disclosure of which would have demonstrated that the application was without merit and that there was no basis for the granting of an ex parte order.

### **Material Non-Disclosures**

6.  **The True Timeline of Events:** Peter failed to disclose that on June 6, 2025, Daniel submitted comprehensive reports to Mr. Danie Bantjies (Bantjies), detailing serious financial irregularities within the companies. The very next day, on June 7, 2025, Peter retaliated by cancelling 15 business credit cards, thereby crippling the company's R34.9 million e-commerce operation. This timeline is attached hereto as **Annexure CA-2**.

7.  **The Self-Created Urgency:** The urgency cited by Peter in his application was a direct consequence of his own actions. By cancelling the credit cards, he created a financial crisis and then used that crisis as a pretext to approach the court on an urgent basis. This is a classic case of self-created urgency, which this Honourable Court should not condone.

8.  **The Conflicts of Interest of Danie Bantjies:** Peter presented Bantjies as an independent party who had uncovered financial misconduct. He failed to disclose that Bantjies is:
    *   A co-Trustee of the Faucitt Family Trust alongside Peter.
    *   A personal debtor to Peter in the amount of R18.685 million (see **Annexure CA-6**).
    *   The accountant for the very companies he was supposedly investigating.
    *   The Commissioner of Oaths who signed Peter's founding affidavit.

These multiple conflicts of interest destroy Bantjies's credibility as an independent witness and demonstrate the collusive nature of Peter's application.

9.  I submit that, had these material facts been disclosed, this Honourable Court would not have granted the ex parte order. The order was obtained through a breach of the duty of *uberrima fides* (utmost good faith) and should be set aside on this basis alone.

## **PART B: DECLARATION OF DELINQUENCY (PETER FAUCITT)**

10. In addition to setting aside the ex parte order, I seek an order declaring Peter a delinquent director in terms of Section 162(5) of the Companies Act 71 of 2008. I am advised that this Honourable Court **must** grant such an order if it is proven that Peter, while a director, acted in a manner that amounted to gross negligence, wilful misconduct, or breach of trust.

### **Wilful Misconduct**

11. **Sabotage of Company Operations:** Peter's cancellation of the 15 business credit cards was a deliberate and malicious act of sabotage. It was calculated to inflict maximum harm on the company and to punish Daniel for exposing financial misconduct. This is a clear case of wilful misconduct.

12. **Manufacturing a Crisis:** Peter's actions in manufacturing a crisis to justify his ex parte application were a wilful abuse of the court process. He knowingly misled the court to obtain an order to which he was not entitled.

### **Gross Negligence**

13. **Gross Financial Mismanagement:** Peter has demonstrated a reckless disregard for his duties as a director by allowing gross financial mismanagement to occur under his watch. This includes:
    *   A R5.4 million "stock adjustment" in Strategic Logistics (SLG) with no proper explanation (see **Annexure CA-4**).
    *   Two years of unallocated expenses that were suddenly "dumped" into RegimA Worldwide's accounts, exposing the company to significant tax liabilities (see **Annexure CA-10**).

### **Breach of Trust**

14. **Abuse of Fiduciary Position as Trustee:** As a Trustee of the Faucitt Family Trust, Peter has a duty to act in the best interests of the beneficiaries. Instead, he has used his position to attack a beneficiary (Daniel) who sought to protect the assets of the trust. A copy of the Faucitt Family Trust deed is attached as **Annexure CA-5**.

15. **Collusion with Conflicted Parties:** Peter's reliance on the conflicted Bantjies for his "investigation" is a clear breach of his duty to act in the company's best interests. It demonstrates a willingness to prioritize his personal interests over his fiduciary duties.

## **PART C: RELIEF SOUGHT**

16. For the reasons set out above, I respectfully request that this Honourable Court grant the following relief:

    16.1. An order setting aside the ex parte order granted on [Date of Order] in its entirety.

    16.2. An order declaring Peter Faucitt a delinquent director in terms of Section 162(5)(c) of the Companies Act 71 of 2008, for a period of no less than seven years.

    16.3. An order directing the appointment of an independent forensic auditor to conduct a full investigation into the financial affairs of the companies.

    16.4. An order directing the Companies and Intellectual Property Commission (CIPC) to investigate the conduct of Mr. Danie Bantjies.

    16.5. An order directing the payment of R1,035,000 owed to the estate of the late Kayla Faucitt.

    16.6. An order that Peter Faucitt pays the costs of this application on the scale as between attorney and own client.

## **CONCLUSION**

17. Peter Faucitt has abused his position as a director and a trustee to wage a personal vendetta against his own son, a whistleblower who sought to protect the interests of the company. He has misled this Honourable Court, sabotaged the company's operations, and demonstrated a shocking disregard for his fiduciary duties.

18. I submit that the evidence is overwhelming and that this Honourable Court is compelled to declare Peter a delinquent director. I pray that this Honourable Court will grant the relief sought in the Counter-Application.
