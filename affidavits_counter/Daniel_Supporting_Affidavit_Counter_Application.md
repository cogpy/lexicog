**SUPPORTING AFFIDAVIT OF DANIEL FAUCITT IN THE COUNTER-APPLICATION**

---

I, the undersigned,

**DANIEL FAUCITT**

do hereby make oath and say that:

1.  I am an adult male and the Second Respondent in the main application. I am also the son of the Applicant, Peter Faucitt (Peter), and the First Respondent, Jacqueline Faucitt (Jacqueline).

2.  The facts contained in this affidavit are within my personal knowledge, unless the context indicates otherwise, and are to the best of my belief both true and correct.

3.  I have read the founding affidavit of Jacqueline in the Counter-Application and I confirm the contents thereof. This affidavit is filed in support of the Counter-Application and will provide further detail on the financial misconduct and sabotage that I uncovered.

## **PART A: THE FINANCIAL MISCONDUCT**

4.  In my capacity as a director of RegimA Worldwide, I became aware of serious financial irregularities within the company and its related entities. I conducted a thorough investigation and compiled a series of reports detailing my findings.

5.  On June 6, 2025, I submitted these reports to Mr. Danie Bantjies (Bantjies), who I believed at the time to be an independent party tasked with investigating the company's finances. A copy of these reports is attached as **Annexure CA-9**.

6.  My reports detailed, among other things:
    *   A R5.4 million "stock adjustment" in Strategic Logistics (SLG), which had no supporting documentation and appeared to be a fraudulent write-off (see **Annexure CA-4**).
    *   Two years of unallocated expenses that had been improperly accounted for, exposing the company to significant tax liabilities (see **Annexure CA-10**).
    *   A systematic pattern of revenue stream hijacking, where income from RegimA SA and RegimA Worldwide was being diverted to other entities controlled by Peter (see **Annexure CA-7**).

## **PART B: THE SABOTAGE AND RETALIATION**

7.  The day after I submitted my reports to Bantjies, on June 7, 2025, Peter took retaliatory action by cancelling 15 business credit cards that were essential for the company's operations. This was a deliberate act of sabotage designed to punish me for exposing his misconduct.

8.  The cancellation of these cards had a devastating impact on the company's R34.9 million e-commerce business. We were unable to pay for:
    *   International suppliers, resulting in a disruption of our supply chain.
    *   Software subscriptions for our e-commerce platforms, leading to the shutdown of 51 online stores.
    *   Hosting and other essential services.

9.  A full schedule of the cancelled cards and the impact of their cancellation is attached as **Annexure CA-1**.

10. Peter's actions were not those of a director acting in the best interests of the company. They were the actions of a man who was willing to destroy the company to cover up his own wrongdoing.

## **PART C: THE MANUFACTURED URGENCY**

11. The crisis that Peter described in his ex parte application was a direct result of his own actions. He created the crisis by cancelling the credit cards and then used that crisis as a pretext to approach the court on an urgent basis.

12. The timeline of events, attached as **Annexure CA-2**, clearly shows that there was no urgency until Peter manufactured it. This was a deliberate and calculated abuse of the court process.

## **PART D: THE CONFLICTS OF INTEREST OF DANIE BANTJIES**

13. I confirm that Peter failed to disclose to this Honourable Court the multiple conflicts of interest of his key witness, Danie Bantjies. As set out in Jacqueline's affidavit, Bantjies is not an independent party. He is deeply beholden to Peter, both personally and professionally.

14. I attach as **Annexure CA-6** a loan agreement showing that Bantjies is indebted to Peter in the amount of R18.685 million. This financial dependence makes it impossible for Bantjies to act impartially.

## **CONCLUSION**

15. I confirm that I support the relief sought in the Counter-Application, including the declaration of Peter as a delinquent director. His conduct has been egregious and has caused immense harm to the company and its stakeholders.

16. I am prepared to provide this Honourable Court with a full and detailed account of the financial misconduct that I uncovered, and I am confident that, once the evidence is heard, this Honourable Court will grant the relief sought.
