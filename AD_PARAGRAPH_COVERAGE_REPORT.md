2. **Perjury Exposure:** The affidavits expose multiple false statements in Peter's founding affidavit, particularly regarding UK operations and financial flows.

3. **Conflict of Interest:** The affidavits highlight the material non-disclosure of Bantjies's triple role, which undermines the credibility of Peter's claims.

4. **Counter-Delinquency Grounds:** The affidavits establish grounds for a counter-application to declare Peter delinquent based on his unauthorized transfers, card cancellation sabotage, perjury, and abuse of process.

5. **Balance of Convenience:** The affidavits demonstrate that the balance of convenience overwhelmingly favors setting aside the ex parte order.

1. **No Further AD Paragraph Updates Required:** All 100 AD paragraphs are comprehensively addressed.

2. **Maintain Current Structure:** The grouping of AD paragraphs in the answering affidavits is logical and effective.
