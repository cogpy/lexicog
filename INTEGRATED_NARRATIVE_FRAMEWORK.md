## The Complete Story Arc

### Act I: Building Success (2017-2024)

Jacqueline Faucitt built RegimA Skin Treatments over 33 years into one of South Africa's most successful skin treatment companies, winning all major industry awards. She serves as CEO and is the only person at the office who can treat patients. She is essential as the Responsible Person for UK and European business operations.

Daniel Faucitt and Kayla Pretorius built a global e-commerce operation generating R34.9 million annually through 51+ Shopify stores. RegimA SA operated 25 stores with R8.5M turnover, while RegimA Zone (UK) operated 26 stores with R26.4M turnover. The UK company funded SA operations with R84,661+ annually, creating profitable operations across all entities.

### Act II: Discovery and Confrontation (March-May 2025)

On March 30, 2025, Rynette Farrar and Peter Faucitt dumped two years of unallocated expenses from all companies into RegimA Worldwide, pressuring Daniel to sign off within 12 hours for SARS VAT and Annual Accounts. Daniel used the time until June 6 to finalize comprehensive reports and uncover fraud.

On May 15, 2025, Jacqueline confronted Rynette about R1,035,000 owed to Kayla Pretorius's estate since February 2023, stating Rynette was "profiting from proceeds of murder." Seven days later, on May 22, Shopify data was expunged. Fourteen days after the confrontation, on May 29, the domain regimaskin.co.za was registered by Adderory (Rynette's son's company).

On June 6, 2025, Daniel exposed Villa Via fraud to Danie Jacobus Bantjies, the accountant. Daniel provided comprehensive reports documenting the fraud, including Villa Via's 86% profit margin and excessive profit extraction from the group.

### Act III: Systematic Retaliation (June-August 2025)

One day after Daniel's fraud exposure on June 6, Peter cancelled 15 cards on June 7, 2025, rendering Daniel unable to access documentation or continue operations. Four days after the fraud exposure, on June 10, Bantjies dismissed Daniel's audit request, claiming he was "going on holiday."

On June 20, 2025, Gee (database administrator) sent an email explaining to Jacqueline that she had been instructed to send out a message stating "don't use regima.zone, only use regimaskin.co.za email." This diverted customers to Adderory's domain.

On July 8, 2025, warehouse operations were stopped by Peter's instruction, destroying the operational capacity of the R34.9M e-commerce business.

On August 11, 2025, Jacqueline was deceived into signing a "Main Trustee" document, which was backdated to July 1, 2025. Two days later, on August 13, the interdict was granted ex parte, preventing Jacqueline and Daniel from conducting business.

### Act IV: The Ex Parte Deception (August 2025)

Peter's founding affidavit contained material non-disclosures and false statements. Bantjies certified the affidavit as Commissioner of Oaths despite being an undisclosed trustee of the Faucitt Family Trust and owing R18.685M to the trust (payout schedule: May 2026, 2027, 2029).

The affidavit falsely stated that SA companies funded UK operations, when evidence proves the opposite: UK → SA flow of R84,661+ annually. The affidavit omitted revenue context for IT expenses, characterizing R6.7M (2024) and R2.1M (2025) as "unexplainable" when they represented 19.3% and 6.1% of R34.9M annual revenue - reasonable operational costs.

The affidavit manipulated the timeline to create false urgency, claiming recent discovery when Daniel had exposed the fraud to Bantjies on June 6, and there was a 67-day delay between Daniel's cooperation and the interdict application.

### Act V: Final Sabotage (September 2025)

On September 11, 2025, the accounts were emptied with R1.73M transferred. Daniel had been paying creditors despite 6 months of systematic sabotage. The accounts were emptied to prevent Daniel from continuing operations.

## The Network of Control

### Bantjies: The Hidden Hand

Danie Jacobus Bantjies of Bantjes and Company serves in four conflicting roles:

**Trustee:** Undisclosed trustee of the Faucitt Family Trust, giving him control over trust decisions and assets.

**Debtor:** Owes R18.685M to the Faucitt Family Trust with payout schedule in May 2026, 2027, and 2029. This creates a massive conflict of interest - he controls the entity to which he owes millions.

**Accountant:** Serves as accountant for all RegimA companies, giving him access to all financial systems and the ability to give instructions to Rynette Farrar for multi-million rand transactions.

**Commissioner of Oaths:** Certified Peter's founding affidavit despite the material conflicts of interest and non-disclosures.

Bantjies received Daniel's fraud report on June 6, 2025, exposing Villa Via's excessive profit extraction. Four days later, on June 10, Bantjies dismissed Daniel's audit request, claiming he was "going on holiday." Bantjies had motive to prevent discovery of fraud that might reveal his R18.685M debt or the control structure he managed.

### Rynette Farrar: The Administrator

Rynette Farrar controlled all operational systems while Peter had no access:

**Email Control:** Controlled the accounting system using Peter's email (pete@regima.com), despite Peter not using computers.

**Bank Control:** Controlled all bank accounts and performed all banking transactions daily, while Peter does not do any banking.

**Accounting Control:** Controlled the Sage accounting system, where two years of expenses remained unallocated despite her sister Linda being employed as bookkeeper.

**Transaction Authority:** Made substantial payments allegedly under Bantjies's instructions, as stated in an email concerning a SARS audit regarding the R5.4M stock adjustment.

Rynette made a false statement claiming the R1,035,000 debt to Kayla Pretorius's estate had been paid, when it remained unpaid since February 2023. When Jacqueline confronted her about this on May 15, 2025, retaliation began seven days later with Shopify data expungement.

### Adderory (Rynette's Son): The Beneficiary

Adderory's company benefited from the systematic sabotage:

**Domain Registration:** Registered the competing domain regimaskin.co.za on May 29, 2025, fourteen days after Jacqueline's confrontation with Rynette.

**Stock Supply:** Supplied stock to RegimA Skin Treatments - the same type of stock as the R5.4M that "disappeared" from Strategic Logistics in a suspicious inventory adjustment.

**Customer Diversion:** Received diverted customers through the instruction to use regimaskin.co.za instead of regima.zone.

**Logo Appropriation:** Rynette took the RegimA logo and registered it in Adderory's name.

### Peter: The Figurehead

Peter Faucitt had no operational control despite being named as applicant:

**No Email Access:** Email controlled by Rynette using pete@regima.com. Peter does not use computers.

**No Bank Access:** All banking controlled by Rynette. Peter does not do any banking.

**No Accounting Access:** Accounting system controlled by Rynette. Peter has no access to financial systems.

**Limited Actions:** Peter's documented actions were limited to card cancellations (June 7, 2025) and signing documents prepared by others.

This raises the critical question: Who was actually directing Peter's actions if he had no access to the systems or information needed to make informed decisions?

## The Evidence Web

### Timeline of Retaliation

**Jacqueline's Investigation (May 15, 2025):**

Jacqueline confronted Rynette about R1,035,000 owed to Kayla Pretorius's estate since February 2023. Rynette had falsely claimed the debt was paid. Jacqueline stated Rynette was "profiting from proceeds of murder."

The retaliation was immediate and systematic:
- May 22 (7 days later): Shopify data expunged
- May 29 (14 days later): Domain regimaskin.co.za registered by Adderory
- June 20: Customer diversion email sent

**Daniel's Fraud Exposure (June 6, 2025):**

Daniel provided comprehensive reports to Bantjies exposing Villa Via fraud, including 86% profit margin and excessive profit extraction. Daniel cooperated fully, providing all requested documentation.

The retaliation was immediate and systematic:
- June 7 (1 day later): 15 cards cancelled by Peter
- June 10 (4 days later): Bantjies dismisses audit request
- June 20: Customer diversion email sent
- July 8: Warehouse operations stopped
- August 13: Interdict granted

**Convergence Pattern:**

Both Jacqueline and Daniel were punished immediately after fulfilling their fiduciary duties. Jacqueline investigated a debt to the estate as a trustee should. Daniel exposed fraud as a director should. Both actions threatened the control structure managed by Bantjies and Rynette.

The systematic destruction of the R34.9M annual operations was not mismanagement by the respondents - it was retaliation by those who controlled the systems.

### Financial Web

**Revenue and Operations:**

The e-commerce operations generated R34.9 million annually through 51+ Shopify stores:
- RegimA SA: 25 stores, R8.5M turnover
- RegimA Zone (UK): 26 stores, R26.4M turnover

The UK company (RegimA Zone Ltd, UK 10697009) funded SA operations with R84,661+ annually, proven by bank records and Shopify invoices. This directly contradicts Peter's claim that SA companies funded UK operations.

IT expenses of R6.7M (2024) and R2.1M (2025) represented 19.3% and 6.1% of revenue respectively - reasonable operational costs for global e-commerce. Peter deliberately omitted the revenue context to create a misleading impression.

**Actual Financial Fraud:**

R900,000 in unauthorized transfers were made from RegimA SA FNB account on February 14-15, 2025, without Daniel's authority as co-director. These transfers occurred while Rynette controlled all banking.

R5.4 million in stock "disappeared" from Strategic Logistics in a suspicious inventory adjustment. This is the same type of stock supplied by Adderory (Rynette's son's company). The adjustment was 10x larger than the prior year and represented 46% of annual sales. Rynette claimed in an email that Bantjies instructed her to make huge payments related to this stock adjustment.

R1,035,000 has been owed to Kayla Pretorius's estate since February 2023. Rynette falsely claimed this debt was paid. When Jacqueline confronted her about this on May 15, 2025, systematic retaliation began.

Villa Via extracted profits at an 86% profit margin, creating excessive profit extraction from the group while other entities were kept in debt. This was part of the fraud Daniel exposed to Bantjies on June 6, 2025.

**Revenue Stream Hijacking:**

The systematic sabotage included diversion of revenue streams, leaving Daniel responsible for payments to creditors while his ability to pay was sabotaged:

- March 1, 2025: Diversion started with RegimA SA
- April 14, 2025: Rynette bank letter for RegimA Worldwide diversion
- May 23, 2025: Removal of orders from Shopify
- June 7, 2025: Secret card cancellations
- June 20, 2025: Email instruction to use regimaskin.co.za instead of regima.zone
- September 11, 2025: Accounts emptied (R1.73M) because Daniel was still paying creditors despite 6 months of sabotage

### Control Structure Web

**Rynette's Control Mechanisms:**
- Email system (pete@regima.com) - Peter doesn't use computers
- All bank accounts - Peter doesn't do banking
- Accounting system (Sage) - Two years unallocated expenses
- Daily transactions - Complete operational control

**Bantjies's Control Mechanisms:**
- Faucitt Family Trust (undisclosed trustee)
- All companies (as accountant)
- Financial systems (gave instructions to Rynette)
- Certification authority (Commissioner of Oaths)

**Peter's Lack of Control:**
- No email access
- No bank access
- No accounting access
- No computer use
- No banking activity

This control structure reveals that Peter could not have made informed decisions about the matters in his founding affidavit. Someone else was directing the actions taken in his name.

## Cross-References to Repository Evidence

### Warehouse Fraud Evidence

The warehouse operations were stopped on July 8, 2025, by Peter's instruction. This destroyed the operational capacity of the R34.9M e-commerce business. Jacqueline's essential role as CEO for 33 years made her irreplaceable for RegimA Skin Treatments operations. She is the only person at the office who can treat patients and is essential as the Responsible Person for UK/European business.

**Repository Links:**
- Warehouse sabotage documentation
- Operational impact analysis
- Jacqueline's role and qualifications

### Perjury Analysis

Peter's founding affidavit contains demonstrable false statements about UK payment flows. The affidavit implies SA → UK payment flow, suggesting South African companies funded UK operations. Bank records and Shopify invoices prove the opposite: UK → SA flow of R84,661+ annually.

**Repository Links:**
- UK payment flow evidence (AD 11.2-12.4)
- Shopify invoices
- RegimA Zone UK bank transactions
- Material non-disclosures analysis

### UK Funding Perjury

Daniel personally funded all UK operations with his own cards. The UK company (RegimA Zone Ltd, UK 10697009) funded SA operations, not vice versa. Peter has no role whatsoever in UK entities and does not own any UK entities. Only Jacqueline and Daniel are essential for UK operations.

**Repository Links:**
- RegimA Zone UK bank statements
- Shopify invoice analysis
- UK company ownership documentation
- Daniel's personal funding evidence

### Systematic Blackout

Two years of expenses remained unallocated in the accounting system controlled by Rynette using Peter's email (pete@regima.com). This occurred despite Linda (Rynette's sister) being employed as bookkeeper and Bantjies serving as accountant. On March 30, 2025, these unallocated expenses were dumped into RegimA Worldwide with 12 hours given to Daniel to sign off for SARS.

**Repository Links:**
- Unallocated expenses analysis
- March 30, 2025 expense dumping
- Rynette's control documentation
- Linda's employment records

### Power Structure

Bantjies controlled the trust (as undisclosed trustee), the companies (as accountant), and the financial systems (giving instructions to Rynette). He also owed R18.685M to the trust with payout in May 2026, 2027, and 2029. This created a massive conflict of interest where he controlled the entity to which he owed millions.

**Repository Links:**
- Bantjies trustee documentation
- R18.685M debt payout schedule
- Bantjies's instructions to Rynette
- Commissioner of Oaths certification conflict

### Nine Prong Attack

The systematic sabotage followed a clear pattern of retaliation after Jacqueline's confrontation (May 15) and Daniel's fraud exposure (June 6):

1. Shopify data expungement (May 22)
2. Domain registration by Adderory (May 29)
3. Card cancellations (June 7)
4. Audit dismissal (June 10)
5. Customer diversion email (June 20)
6. Warehouse sabotage (July 8)
7. "Main Trustee" deception (August 11)
8. Interdict grant (August 13)
9. Account emptying (September 11)

**Repository Links:**

- Retaliation pattern analysis
- Nine prong attack documentation

### Criminal Motive Analysis

Bantjies had R18.685M in motive to prevent discovery of the control structure and financial fraud. The R1,035,000 debt to Kayla's estate provided motive for Rynette to prevent investigation. The R5.4M stock "disappeared" from Strategic Logistics - the same type supplied by Adderory - provided motive for Adderory to benefit from the sabotage.

## Narrative Strategy: Gradual Revelation Technique

### Layer 1: Surface Claims

Peter claims urgency, mismanagement, and need for protection of trust assets. The founding affidavit presents a narrative of concerned father protecting family interests from wayward wife and son.

### Layer 2: Timeline Contradictions

The 67-day delay between Daniel's cooperation (June 6) and interdict application (August 13) contradicts any claim of urgency. Card cancellation occurred one day after Daniel's cooperation, not before. The interdict was granted two days after Jacqueline signed the "Main Trustee" document, suggesting coordination rather than urgency.

### Layer 3: Control Structure Revelation

Rynette controlled everything using Peter's email (pete@regima.com), despite Peter not using computers. Peter had no access to banks, despite Rynette controlling all banking. Peter had no access to accounting, despite two years of unallocated expenses. Rynette claimed to act under Bantjies's instructions.

### Layer 4: Financial Connections Emerge

Bantjies is revealed as undisclosed trustee owing R18.685M to the trust. Adderory benefits from domain registration and customer diversion. The R5.4M stock "disappeared" is the same type Adderory supplies. Rynette's sister Linda was employed as bookkeeper, yet expenses were unallocated for two years.

### Layer 5: The Pattern Becomes Clear

Jacqueline investigates R1,035,000 debt (May 15) → immediate retaliation begins (May 22, May 29). Daniel exposes fraud (June 6) → immediate sabotage begins (June 7, June 10). Both were punished for fulfilling their fiduciary duties. The systematic destruction of R34.9M operations was not mismanagement - it was punishment.

### Layer 6: The Truth Revealed

This is not a case of mismanagement by Jacqueline and Daniel. This is systematic fraud by Bantjies and Rynette, with Peter as a figurehead who had no access to the information or systems needed to make informed decisions. The interdict was not protection - it was punishment for threatening to expose the control structure and financial fraud.

The evidence reveals:
- Not mismanagement, but systematic fraud
- Not urgency, but manufactured crisis
- Not protection, but punishment
- Not Peter in control, but Bantjies and Rynette

## Implementation Guidance

### For Jacqueline's Affidavit

**Key Sections to Develop:**

Jacqueline should establish her role as trustee and CEO, demonstrating 33 years of building RegimA Skin Treatments into an award-winning company. She should detail her May 15, 2025 confrontation with Rynette about the R1,035,000 debt to Kayla's estate, emphasizing this was fulfillment of fiduciary duty.

The immediate retaliation timeline must be documented: Shopify data expunged 7 days later (May 22), domain registered by Adderory 14 days later (May 29), customer diversion email sent (June 20). This establishes the pattern of punishment for investigating fraud.

Jacqueline should detail the deception into signing the "Main Trustee" document on August 11, 2025 (backdated to July 1), followed by the interdict grant 2 days later on August 13. This demonstrates coordination and manufactured urgency.

The daily operational damage from the interdict should be documented, emphasizing that Jacqueline is the only person at the office who can treat patients and is essential as Responsible Person for UK/European business operations.

- RegimA Skin Treatments awards and qualifications - [Annexure JR-7]
- UK Responsible Person documentation - [Annexure JR-8]

### For Daniel's Affidavit

**Key Sections to Develop:**

Daniel should establish the building of R34.9M operations with Kayla Pretorius through 51+ Shopify stores (RegimA SA: 25 stores, R8.5M; RegimA Zone UK: 26 stores, R26.4M). This demonstrates profitable management, not mismanagement.

The March 30, 2025 expense dumping should be detailed: two years of unallocated expenses dumped into RegimA Worldwide with 12 hours to sign off for SARS. Daniel used this time until June 6 to finalize comprehensive reports uncovering fraud.

The June 6, 2025 fraud exposure to Bantjies must be documented, including Villa Via's 86% profit margin, R5.4M stock "disappeared" from Strategic Logistics, and R1,035,000 debt to Kayla's estate. This establishes Daniel's cooperation and fulfillment of director duties.

The immediate retaliation timeline must be documented: 15 cards cancelled 1 day later (June 7), audit request dismissed 4 days later (June 10), warehouse sabotage (July 8), account emptying (September 11). This establishes the pattern of punishment for exposing fraud.

UK funding evidence must be presented: bank records and Shopify invoices proving UK → SA flow of R84,661+ annually, contradicting Peter's false claim of SA → UK flow.

IT expenses context must be provided: R6.7M (2024) and R2.1M (2025) represented 19.3% and 6.1% of R34.9M revenue - reasonable operational costs deliberately mischaracterized by omitting revenue context.

Daniel should document continued creditor payments despite 6 months of systematic sabotage, demonstrating commitment and capability contradicting allegations of mismanagement.

## Complementary Narrative Structure

Jacqueline's affidavit should focus on:
- Trustee role and fiduciary duty fulfillment
- CEO role and operational essentiality
- May 15 confrontation and immediate retaliation
- August 11 deception and August 13 punishment
- Daily operational damage from interdict

Daniel's affidavit should focus on:
- Building profitable R34.9M operations
- March 30 expense dumping trap
- June 6 fraud exposure and immediate retaliation
- UK funding evidence contradicting Peter's claims
- IT expenses context deliberately omitted by Peter
- Systematic sabotage timeline
- Continued operations despite sabotage

Together, the affidavits should reveal:
- Both fulfilled fiduciary duties
- Both were punished for threatening control structure
- Peter had no access to systems or information
- Bantjies and Rynette controlled everything
- The interdict was punishment, not protection
- The fraud was by Bantjies and Rynette, not by respondents

---

## Legal Principles to Invoke

### Venire Contra Factum Proprium

Peter cancelled Daniel's cards on June 7, 2025, one day after Daniel cooperated by providing comprehensive reports. Peter then complained about missing documentation that became inaccessible due to his own card cancellations. This constitutes acting contrary to one's own previous conduct.

**Application:** Peter created the problem he complains about, then used it as justification for the interdict.

### Material Non-Disclosure

Peter's founding affidavit failed to disclose:
- Bantjies's status as undisclosed trustee
- Bantjies's R18.685M debt to the trust
- UK → SA payment flow (claimed opposite)
- R34.9M revenue context for IT expenses
- Daniel's June 6 fraud exposure to Bantjies
- Jacqueline's May 15 investigation of debt

**Application:** The ex parte interdict was obtained through material non-disclosures that would have changed the court's decision.

### Conflict of Interest

Bantjies served as:
- Trustee (undisclosed)
- Debtor (R18.685M)
- Accountant (all companies)
- Commissioner of Oaths (certified affidavit)

**Application:** Bantjies had disqualifying conflicts of interest that invalidate his certification and participation.

### Fiduciary Duty

Jacqueline investigated R1,035,000 debt to Kayla's estate as a trustee should. Daniel exposed fraud as a director should. Both fulfilled their fiduciary duties and were punished for it.

**Application:** The interdict punishes proper fulfillment of fiduciary duties, which is contrary to law.
