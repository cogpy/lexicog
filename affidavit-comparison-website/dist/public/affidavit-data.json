      "7.1": "I deny the Applicant's claim that his accountant, Mr. Danie Bantjies, attended the office in mid-June 2025 for provisional tax and VAT submissions. The Second Respondent provided comprehensive reports to Mr. Bantjies on **6 June 2025**, exposing the fraud involving Villa Via Arcadia No 2 CC's excessive profit extraction (86% margin on rent). Mr. Bantjies is the third trustee of the Faucitt Family Trust, a fact concealed from the beneficiaries, and owes the Applicant R18.685 million (Annexure **SF1**).",
      "7.2": "The Applicant's claim that Mr. Bantjies \"noted discrepancies\" in July 2025 is a misrepresentation. The discrepancies were reported **to** Mr. Bantjies by the Second Respondent on 6 June 2025. The very next day, **7 June 2025**, the Applicant cancelled 15 business credit cards (Annexure **DF4**), demonstrating consciousness of guilt and retaliation for the exposure of fraud.",
      "7.3": "The Applicant mischaracterizes legitimate IT expenses as \"irregular payments.\" These expenses relate to the 51 Shopify stores and associated software infrastructure required to generate **R34.9 million** in annual revenue. The true irregularities are: (1) R5.4 million stock adjustment in Strategic Logistics CC (46% of annual sales); (2) R900,000 unauthorized transfers from RegimA SA; (3) Villa Via's 86% profit margin on rent.",
      "7.4": "The Applicant's characterization of the Second Respondent's conduct as \"increasingly erratic\" is unfounded and defamatory. The Second Respondent was managing a profitable global e-commerce operation generating R34.9 million annually. His conduct was professional and transparent, as evidenced by his provision of comprehensive reports to Mr. Bantjies on 6 June 2025.",
      "7.5.1": "The Applicant's claim that payments \"could not be explained\" is false. The Second Respondent provided comprehensive reports on 6 June 2025, including detailed financial analysis and evidence of fraud.",
      "7.5.2": "The Applicant cancelled 15 business credit cards on **7 June 2025**, one day after receiving the Second Respondent's reports. This timing demonstrates a manufactured crisis and application of the doctrine of *venire contra factum proprium* (estoppel). The Applicant cannot complain of a situation he deliberately created.",
      "7.5.3": "The Applicant cancelled his own card \"for the sake thereof,\" suggesting awareness that the card cancellations were punitive rather than protective.",
      "7.6": "The Applicant's claim that \"the majority of the transactions remain unexplained\" is contradicted by the comprehensive reports provided on 6 June 2025. The Applicant's refusal to accept these explanations was part of the retaliation strategy.",
      "7.7": "I confirm that the Applicant's card cancellations on 7 June 2025 caused service interruptions, including the halting of internet domains and essential business subscriptions. This was the direct and foreseeable consequence of the Applicant's own actions.",
      "7.8": "The Applicant's allegation that the Second Respondent \"adopted a 'superior' position and effectively refused to assist\" is false. The Second Respondent had already provided comprehensive assistance on 6 June 2025. The Applicant's characterization is an attempt to justify his retaliatory conduct.",
      "7.9": "The inter-office communications referenced by the Applicant (Annexure PF7) demonstrate the Second Respondent's professionalism and the Applicant's unreasonable demands following the card cancellations.",
      "7.10": "The Applicant's communications were with the Second Respondent's personal assistant because the Applicant had already cancelled the business credit cards, creating a crisis that required immediate attention.",
      "7.11": "The Applicant's claim that the Second Respondent \"would or could not provide relevant invoices\" is contradicted by the comprehensive reports provided on 6 June 2025, which included detailed financial documentation.",
      "7.12": "The Applicant's allegation that the Second Respondent \"interfered with the corporations' staff doing their jobs\" is an inversion of the facts. The interference came from the Applicant and his agents, who:\n- Cancelled 15 business credit cards (7 June 2025)\n- Revoked the Second Respondent's email access (retaliation for reporting fraud)\n- Diverted company revenue to competing entities owned by Ms. Farrar's son\n- Expunged Shopify audit data (22 May 2025)",
      "7.13.1": "The Applicant's claim regarding email access is misleading. The Second Respondent's access to email and accounting systems was revoked in retaliation for exposing financial misconduct on 6 June 2025.",
      "7.13.2": "The selective restoration of email access \"on an ad hoc basis\" was controlled by Ms. Farrar, who had control of the Applicant's email address (pete@regima.com) and all company systems (Annexures **SF2**, **SF4**).",
      "7.14": "The \"continued interference\" referenced by the Applicant was the systematic sabotage orchestrated by the Applicant's agents, including:\n- Revenue diversion from RegimA SA (from 1 March 2025)\n- Revenue diversion from RegimA Worldwide Distribution (from 14 April 2025, Annexure **DF12**)\n- Customer diversion to regimaskin.co.za, owned by Ms. Farrar's son (Annexure **JF8**)\n- Warehouse sabotage (July 2025, Annexure **DF13**)",
      "7.15": "The conduct \"not in the interests of the corporations\" was the Applicant's systematic dismantling of a profitable R34.9 million operation in retaliation for the Second Respondent's exposure of fraud.",
      "7.16.1": "I confirm that I approached the banks (FNB and ABSA) to obtain duplicate cards on or about 24 June 2025. This action was necessary to prevent the total collapse of the business operations following the Applicant's punitive card cancellations on 7 June 2025.",
      "7.16.2": "The use of personal credit cards to maintain business operations demonstrates the Applicant's bad faith and the manufactured nature of the crisis.",
      "7.17.1": "The Applicant's claim that I \"rejected any idea of malfeasance or neglect on our son's part\" is false. I defended the Second Respondent because he had acted professionally and transparently, providing comprehensive reports on 6 June 2025.",
      "7.17.2": "The Applicant's characterization of my response as \"I will show you\" is a misrepresentation designed to portray me as defiant rather than protective of legitimate business interests.",
      "7.18.1": "I deny transferring R500,000 to the Second Respondent on or about 16 July 2025 as a \"birthday gift.\" This allegation is false and unsupported by evidence.",
      "7.18.2": "The Applicant's claim that I have \"no other sources of income other than remuneration by the third to sixth respondents\" is irrelevant to the allegations and appears designed to undermine my financial independence.",
      "7.18.3": "If any transfer occurred on 16 July 2025, it would have been a legitimate business transaction, not a personal gift. The Applicant provides no evidence (bank statements, invoices, or transfer documentation) to support this allegation.",
      "7.19": "I deny that any transfer was made \"without the Applicant's knowledge.\" As the sole trustee with absolute powers over the Faucitt Family Trust (which owns RegimA Worldwide and Villa Via), and with Ms. Farrar controlling all bank accounts under Mr. Bantjies's instructions, the Applicant had full visibility of all financial transactions.",
      "7.20": "The Applicant's claim that any alleged transfer was \"separate to remuneration as director/member\" is speculative and unsupported. The Second Respondent's remuneration structure included performance-based compensation for managing the R34.9 million e-commerce operation.\n\n---"

Mr. Bantjies, as the Applicant's accountant and a concealed trustee, had a duty to investigate these claims. Instead, he dismissed my request for an audit.",
      "7.2": "The Applicant's claim that discrepancies were \"noted\" in July is false. I reported them on 6 June 2025. The Applicant's immediate cancellation of 15 business credit cards on **7 June 2025** was a direct act of retaliation and sabotage.",
      "7.3": "The IT expenses were legitimate and necessary for the R34.9 million e-commerce operation I built. The true irregularities, which I reported, were the R5.4 million stock adjustment, the R900,000 unauthorized transfers, and Villa Via's 86% profit extraction.",

      "11.1": "I pause to mention that, we also began companies in the United Kingdom, which sell the applicant's products - and which my son has been appointed to direct and manage.",
      "11.2": "These companies fall under the UK head o\ufb03ce, being RegimA UK Ltd.",
      "11.3": "My wife, my son, and I are the directors thereof.",
      "11.4": "While my involvement has been minimal I, inter alia, ensure operational growth, and manage the respondent corporations.",
      "11.5": "My son was appointed to oversee the UK branch, which carries under it, as umbrella, RegimA @ Dr H Ltd, RegimA Zone Ltd, RegimA Zone Academy Ltd and RegimA Medic Ltd.",
      "11.6": "The third to sixth respondents ship to the UK branch, but do not receive payment therefrom due to apparent fraud that transpired in the UK in the past, from which the UK companies allegedly required time to again become \ufb01nancially viable.",
      "11.7": "This was perpetrated by the then managing director of the UK branch, Isaac Chesno, which resultant in our son's appointment.",
      "11.8": "I fear (due to his present conduct) that the continued non-payment (from the UK branch) may inter alia be a ruse.",
      "11.9": "I accordingly have no idea pertaining to the \ufb01nancial wellness of the UK branches, and intend to approach the relevant Court for relief with regards thereto. 12.\tNECESSITY OF RELIEF I say, with respect, that the orders sought under PART B of the notice of motion are essential to the survival of the third to sixth respondents, as the relationship between the directors and members (namely the \ufb01rst and second respondents, and I) has disintegrated and become deadlocked to the extent that they would otherwise have to be liquidated, to my signi\ufb01cant detriment, and to the detriment of my wife, and son, who are sustained by those corporations - as well as to the detriment of the corporations. Needless to say, with respect, the extent to which money appears to have been misappropriated from the third to sixth respondent, (which has unquestionably \ufb02owed out of those corporations, and very irregularly at that), which continues, is not sustainable, has already created signi\ufb01cant taxation problems, and will inescapably lead to their insolvency. I approach this Honourable Court to prevent this. It goes without saying, with respect, that my wife and son can serve those corporations in capacities other than director or member, and can be sustained thereby. 13.\tINTERDICTS SOUGHT I say further, with respect, that the interdicts (and other relief) sought under PART A of the notice of motion are also essential to the survival of the third to sixth respondents; the rot must, with respect, be stopped urgently, which will be impossible in the absence of appropriate interdictory relief, such as is set out in therein. Requirements for Interdict I have, with respect, a clear (and a prima facie) right not to be prejudiced by the unlawful conduct of the \ufb01rst and second respondents that causes such harm to the third to sixth respondents that will inevitably lead to the loss of the entities that sustain me. I have already sustained an injury by way of actual harm caused to those corporations, and I apprehend (reasonably, with respect) further (similar) injury committed by the \ufb01rst and second respondents. Needless to say, with respect, I have a reasonable, and well-grounded apprehension of further, and irreparable harm if the interdicts I seek are not granted. I have no alternative adequate remedy; I am constrained to approach this Honourable Court for essential interdictory (and other) relief, as I now do. The balance of convenience favours, with respect, the granting of the interim interdictory (and other) relief sought under PART A of the notice of motion. In the premises, I say with respect that I am entitled to the relief I seek under PART A of the notice of motion, on an interim, and a \ufb01nal basis. I ask, with respect, that any relief not granted under PART A of the notice of motion be adjudicated under PART B thereof. 14.\tOTHER RELIEF SOUGHT As appears from PART A of the notice of motion, I also ask for orders enabling me to take control of the \ufb01nancial administration of the third to sixth respondents (which is essential for their survival), and to commence and prosecute a forensic investigation into their \ufb01nancial a\ufb00airs, for which purpose the compliance of the \ufb01rst and second respondents is essential. It is vital, with respect, that such funds as may be recovered (pursuant to a forensic investigation) are restored to the aforesaid corporations, so that they can meet their tax obligations, and continue with their businesses. It is also essential that the \ufb01rst and second respondent are constrained to the extent that they can no longer cause \ufb01nancial prejudice to the third to sixth respondents. The forensic audit is also necessary for purposes of PART B of the notice of motion; I have no objection to the \ufb01rst and second respondents continuing to receive their present remuneration until PART B is \ufb01nally adjudicated; it is essential, however, that they are not permitted to participate in the \ufb01nancial administration of the corporations in question until this matter has been \ufb01nally determined. I ask again, with respect, that any relief not granted under PART A of the notice of motion be adjudicated under PART B thereof. 16.\tURGENCY The conduct of the \ufb01rst and second respondents was only discovered (and partially so) during mid June 2025; at that stage we were still trying to establish why those payments had been made, and the authors thereof. On or about 16 July 2025, when the \ufb01rst respondent transferred the sum of R500,000.00 to the second respondent, it became clear that action had to be taken to protect the third to sixth respondents. The conduct, pertaining to unnecessary funds leaving the businesses at the \ufb01rst and/or second respondents' behest, is continual. As may be expected, with respect, I was still in a state of shock (which resulted in me not being able to think clearly) when I approached my attorneys of record for advice, on 05 August 2025. I was unaware that an urgent application to this Honourable Court could be pursued, until advised thereof by my attorneys; if I had known that earlier, there would have been no delay. Following thereupon, instructions, information, discussions, and the appointment of Counsel to settle these papers, was required. I have also been required to proceed, as is extremely di\ufb03cult, with such instructions to my attorneys of record secretively, so as to prevent any funds leaving the corporations as a result of such instructions - or any other untoward 'knee-jerk' reactions. This has, as a result, been a more time consuming manner in which to provide instructions to my attorneys of record. I say with respect, however, that every passing day constitutes a new ground of urgency due to the \ufb01rst and second respondent's reckless, and delinquent conduct that indicates clearly that they will not cease their transgressions. It is probable, with respect, that the third to sixth respondents will su\ufb00er irremediable harm if the \ufb01rst and second respondent's are not stopped from continuing their misconduct as soon as possible. Doubtless, with respect, the misappropriated money has been squandered and/or concealed. In the premises, I say with respect that the third to sixth respondents (and me accordingly) will be unable to obtain substantial, or any relief in due course if this Honourable Court does not come to my assistance urgently. 17.\tEX PARTE APPLICATION This application is lodged ex parte as I fear, with good reason, that the \ufb01rst and/or second respondents will react to the service of this application upon them by misappropriating further sums of money from the aforesaid corporations (as a \"knee jerk reaction\" thereto), due to the \ufb01rst respondent having immediately and de\ufb01antly transferred the sum of R500,000.00 to the second respondent, shortly after I took their cards, as aforesaid, and questioned the transactions. This application serves also (to an extent) the purpose of an anton piller application in that I - having reason to believe that the \ufb01rst and second respondents will conceal or destroy relevant documentation if they are not subject to an appropriate order - request an order that they surrender, forthwith, all documentation (electronic and otherwise) within their possession relating to the administration (\ufb01nancial and otherwise) of the third to sixth respondents, and all login details and passwords to any banking and other online facilities relating thereto. Such applications are usually brought, with respect, on an ex parte basis, for obvious reasons. In the premises we say that the matter is su\ufb03ciently urgent to compel the attention of the above Honourable Court ex parte, on an urgent basis. 18.\tCOSTS I say, with respect, that the costs order sought in the notice of motion are appropriate in the circumstances. PRAYER WHEREFORE, THE ABOVE HONOURABLE COURT IS REQUESTED RESPECTFULLY TO GRANT AN ORDER AS PRAYED IN THE NOTICE OF MOTION. DATED AT PRETORIA ON 13th AUGUST 2025 DEPONENT COMMISSIONER OF OATHS CERTIFICATION I CERTIFY THAT THE DEPONENT HAS ACKNOWLEDGED THAT HE KNOWS AND UNDERSTANDS THE CONTENTS OF THIS AFFIDAVIT, WHICH WAS SIGNED AND SWORN BEFORE ME AT BEDFORDVIEW on 13 AUGUST 2025; THE REGULATIONS CONTAINED IN GOVERNMENT NOTICE NO.
