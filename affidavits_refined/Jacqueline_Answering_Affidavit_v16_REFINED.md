## 3. RESPONSE TO AD PARAGRAPHS 1.1 - 3.13: INTRODUCTION AND PARTIES

**JR 1.1**
The contents of this paragraph are noted.

**JR 1.2**
The contents of this paragraph are noted.

**JR 1.3**
The Applicant's declaration is noted. However, I am advised that the commissioning of this affidavit by Mr. Danie Jacobus Bantjes (“Mr. Bantjes”), who is not merely an independent accountant but an undisclosed trustee of the Faucitt Family Trust with a significant financial interest in its affairs, represents a material non-disclosure that compromises the integrity of this application. [JR-1.3, Trust Deed of Faucitt Family Trust; JR-1.4, Loan agreement between Applicant and Mr. Bantjes]

**JR 2.1 - 2.4**
The contents of these paragraphs are noted.

**JR 3.1 - 3.3**
The identification of the parties is noted.

**JR 3.4.1 & 3.4.2**
The identification of the Third Respondent, RegimA Skin Treatments CC, is noted. It is material to note that this entity has an outstanding debt of R1,035,000 to Rezonance (Pty) Ltd, a company linked to the deceased estate of Kayla Pretorius, a fact known to the Applicant and his agent, Ms. Rynette Farrar (“Ms. Farrar”). [JR-3.4, Correspondence with Ms. Farrar regarding Rezonance debt]

**JR 3.5.1 & 3.5.2**
The identification of the Fourth Respondent, RegimA Worldwide Distribution (Pty) Ltd, is noted. This entity is owned by the Faucitt Family Trust.

**JR 3.6.1 & 3.6.2**
The identification of the Fifth Respondent, Villa Via Arcadia No 2 CC, is noted. I confirm that this entity is owned by the Faucitt Family Trust. It is this entity that the Second Respondent identified as being used to extract excessive profits from the group, a fact he reported to Mr. Bantjes on 6 June 2025. [JR-3.6, Second Respondent’s report to Mr. Bantjes]

**JR 3.7.1 & 3.7.2**
The identification of the Sixth Respondent, Strategic Logistics CC, is noted. This entity was used to record a R5.4 million “stock adjustment” in 2024, a transaction for which Ms. Farrar claimed she received instructions from Mr. Bantjes. [JR-3.7, Email correspondence regarding SARS audit]

**JR 3.8 - 3.10**
The identification of the remaining respondents is noted.

**JR 3.11**
The Applicant’s statement is noted. However, the relief sought has had a direct and catastrophic effect on the operations of the Third to Sixth Respondents.

**JR 3.12**
The reference to myself and the Second Respondent as “my wife” and “my son” is noted.

**JR 3.13**
The Applicant’s identity confirmation is noted. The commissioning of the affidavit by Mr. Bantjes, a conflicted and undisclosed trustee, remains a central point of contention that I am advised will be fully addressed in legal argument. [JR-1.3, Trust Deed of Faucitt Family Trust]

## 4. RESPONSE TO AD PARAGRAPHS 6.1 - 6.5: RELATIONSHIPS

**JR 6.1**
The Applicant misrepresents the operational control structure of the respondent entities. While I am a director and member as stated, the day-to-day financial control was exclusively held by the Applicant’s agent, Ms. Farrar, who had sole access to the bank accounts and the SAGE accounting system. The Applicant himself had no operational access to these accounts. [JR-6.1, Affidavit of Ms. Farrar confirming her control]

**JR 6.2**
The contents of this paragraph are noted.

**JR 6.3**
The Applicant’s statement that he “caused the third to sixth respondent to be created” is noted. However, it was the Second Respondent who built the e-commerce infrastructure that generated R34.9 million in annual revenue, a fact the Applicant omits. On 30 March 2025, the Applicant and Ms. Farrar attempted to dump two years of unallocated expenses into the Second Respondent’s company (RegimA Worldwide) and demanded he sign off on them for SARS submissions within 12 hours, creating a high-pressure situation that ultimately led to the discovery of the Villa Via fraud. [JR-6.3, Second Respondent’s report on e-commerce revenue; JR-6.4, Email from Ms. Farrar dated 30 March 2025]

**JR 6.4**
The banking relationships are noted. It is critical to state, however, that the Applicant had no access to these bank accounts. All financial control was ceded to Ms. Farrar. This arrangement is central to understanding the subsequent financial irregularities. [JR-6.1, Affidavit of Ms. Farrar]

**JR 6.5**
The registration of the entities with CIPC is noted.

## 5. RESPONSE TO AD PARAGRAPHS 7.1 - 7.20: ALLEGED DISCOVERY OF FINANCIAL IRREGULARITIES

**JR 7.1**
The Applicant's reliance on the affidavit of Mr. Bantjes is fundamentally flawed. The Applicant fails to disclose to this Honourable Court that Mr. Bantjes is not an independent accountant but a co-trustee of the Faucitt Family Trust, a position he held in secret from the beneficiaries. Furthermore, Mr. Bantjes has a direct financial conflict of interest, owing a personal debt of R18.685 million to the Applicant. The Second Respondent had, in fact, provided Mr. Bantjes with comprehensive reports detailing financial misconduct, including the Villa Via fraud, on 6 June 2025, which Mr. Bantjes dismissed. [JR-1.3, Trust Deed; JR-1.4, Loan Agreement; JR-3.6, Second Respondent’s report to Mr. Bantjes]

**JR 7.2 - 7.4**
The alleged “discrepancies” and “irregular payments” relating to IT expenses were, in fact, standard and necessary costs for the global e-commerce operation that the Second Respondent built and managed, which generated R34.9 million in annual revenue. The Applicant’s portrayal of these as mysterious is a deliberate misrepresentation designed to create a false narrative of misconduct. The Second Respondent’s conduct was not “erratic”; he was diligently uncovering the true financial malfeasance being perpetrated by the Applicant’s own agents. [JR-6.3, Second Respondent’s report on e-commerce revenue]

**JR 7.5**
The allegation that the payments could not be explained is false. The Applicant’s cancellation of the business bank cards on 7 June 2025 was not a prudent financial measure but a retaliatory and destructive act. This action was taken just one day after the Second Respondent submitted his detailed report to Mr. Bantjes exposing the Villa Via fraud. It was a manufactured crisis designed to sabotage the business and create a pretext for this very application. [JR-3.6, Second Respondent’s report to Mr. Bantjes; JR-7.5, Timeline of events]

**JR 7.6**
This is denied. The Second Respondent had already provided comprehensive reports and explanations on 6 June 2025. The Applicant’s claim that the “majority of the transactions remain unexplained” is a falsehood intended to mislead this Court.

**JR 7.7 - 7.9**
The halting of subscriptions and services was the direct and foreseeable consequence of the Applicant’s own reckless action of cancelling the bank cards. The Second Respondent did not refuse to assist; he had already provided the necessary information. The communications in annexure “PF7” demonstrate the Second Respondent’s professionalism in the face of a crisis manufactured by the Applicant.

**JR 7.10 - 7.12**
The contents of these paragraphs are denied. The Applicant’s assertion that the Second Respondent interfered with staff is an inversion of the truth. It was the Applicant and his agents who systematically interfered with and sabotaged the business operations.

**JR 7.13 - 7.15**
The selective restoration of email access was controlled by Ms. Farrar, acting on the Applicant’s instructions, as a tool of further interference. This conduct, orchestrated by the Applicant, was profoundly contrary to the interests of the corporations.

**JR 7.16 - 7.17**
I confirm that I obtained new bank cards. This was a necessary step to prevent the total collapse of the business operations, which the Applicant had unilaterally paralyzed. I did not reject the idea of malfeasance; I rejected the Applicant’s false accusations against the Second Respondent, as I was aware that the true misconduct lay with the Applicant’s agents.

**JR 7.18 - 7.20**
I deny that I transferred R500,000.00 to the Second Respondent as a “birthday gift.” This is a malicious and unsupported fabrication. Any transfers made were legitimate business transactions, fully documented and necessary for the continued operation of the business in the face of the Applicant’s sabotage. The Applicant’s reference to my income is irrelevant and intended to be demeaning. The Applicant had full visibility of all financial transactions through his agents, Ms. Farrar and Mr. Bantjes, making his claim of acting “without my knowledge” entirely disingenuous.

---

## 6. RESPONSE TO AD PARAGRAPHS 8.1 - 8.10: IT EXPENSES ANALYSIS

**JR 8.1 - 8.3**
The Applicant’s analysis of the IT expenses is misleading. The expenses listed in annexures “PF9” and “PF10” were necessary operational costs for the R34.9 million global e-commerce business developed and managed by the Second Respondent. The Applicant conveniently omits the revenue generated by this infrastructure, creating a distorted picture of profligate spending. The majority of these expenses are for standard services such as cloud hosting, online payment gateways, and digital marketing platforms, for which invoices were available and were provided to Mr. Bantjes. [JR-6.3, Second Respondent’s report on e-commerce revenue]

**JR 8.4 - 8.6**
The figures presented by the Applicant are decontextualized. These amounts represent the investment required to sustain a significant international revenue stream. The true financial irregularities, which the Applicant fails to mention, are the R5.4 million stock adjustment in Strategic Logistics CC, the R900,000 in unauthorized transfers from RegimA SA in February 2025, and the 86% profit extraction from the group via Villa Via Arcadia No 2 CC. [JR-3.7, Email correspondence regarding SARS audit; JR-8.4, Bank Statements for RegimA SA]

**JR 8.7 - 8.10**
The international nature of the expenses is a normal feature of a global e-commerce business. The bank notifications regarding foreign exchange limits are standard and not indicative of any misconduct. The Applicant’s feigned concern for tax compliance is ironic, given that he and his agents created a situation where two years of unallocated expenses were dumped on RegimA Worldwide with a 12-hour deadline for SARS submission, a move designed to pressure the Second Respondent and obstruct proper financial governance. [JR-6.4, Email from Ms. Farrar dated 30 March 2025]

## 7. RESPONSE TO AD PARAGRAPHS 9.1 - 9.4: APPLICANT'S SUMMARY OF MISCONDUCT

**JR 9.1 - 9.4**
The Applicant’s summary is a complete inversion of the facts. The true financial irregularities are not the legitimate IT expenses but the fraudulent schemes orchestrated by the Applicant’s own agents, which the Second Respondent uncovered and attempted to report. The Applicant’s attempt to frame the Second Respondent, who is defended by me based on my knowledge of his professional and transparent conduct, is a clear instance of oppressive and vexatious conduct designed to conceal his own and his agents’ malfeasance. The entire basis for this application is predicated on a false narrative, constructed through material non-disclosures and misrepresentations.

---

## 8. RESPONSE TO AD PARAGRAPHS 10.1 - 10.13: DELINQUENCY APPLICATION

**JR 10.1 - 10.2**
The Applicant seeks an order declaring myself and the Second Respondent delinquent under Section 162 of the Companies Act, 71 of 2008. I am advised that this application is an abuse of process, brought in bad faith and based on manufactured grounds, and that it is the Applicant whose conduct warrants scrutiny under this very section.

**JR 10.3**
This is denied. Our conduct has been to protect the interests of the corporations from the malfeasance of the Applicant’s agents and the Applicant’s own oppressive actions. The Applicant’s assertion is baseless and is contradicted by the evidence of his systematic sabotage of the business.

**JR 10.4**
I am advised that it is the Applicant and his undisclosed co-trustee, Mr. Bantjes, whose conduct is in clear contravention of the Companies Act, the Close Corporations Act, and the Trust Property Control Act. Their actions, including the material non-disclosures in this application, constitute a breach of their fiduciary duties. [JR-10.4, Legal research summary on fiduciary duties]

**JR 10.5.1 & 10.5.2**
There are no grounds to declare myself or the Second Respondent delinquent or place us under probation. I am advised that the threshold for such an order requires conduct of a very serious nature, such as gross abuse of the position of director, which is entirely absent here. To the contrary, our actions were aimed at upholding our fiduciary duties.

**JR 10.6.1 - 10.6.3**
These paragraphs list the duties of a member of a close corporation. I have at all times acted in accordance with these duties. It is the Applicant who has acted without authority and created a material conflict between his personal interests (concealing fraud) and those of the corporations.

**JR 10.7.1.1 & 10.7.1.2**
No loss has been suffered by the corporations as a result of our conduct. The only economic benefit derived has been by the Applicant and his agents through their fraudulent schemes, such as the Villa Via profit extraction. The significant losses incurred by the corporations are a direct result of the Applicant’s sabotage. [JR-3.6, Second Respondent’s report to Mr. Bantjes]

**JR 10.9.1 - 10.9.3.3**
These allegations of gross abuse, intentional harm, and acquiescence in fraudulent acts are denied. They are, however, a precise description of the Applicant’s own conduct. The Applicant has grossly abused his position as trustee and director to launch this vindictive application, has intentionally inflicted harm on the corporations to punish the Second Respondent for whistleblowing, and has acquiesced in the fraudulent acts of his agents, Ms. Farrar and Mr. Bantjes.

**JR 10.10.1 - 10.10.2.3**
This is denied. It is the Applicant’s conduct that has been oppressive and unfairly prejudicial to us as members, directors, and beneficiaries. His actions, including the hijacking of revenue streams and the launching of this ex parte application based on falsehoods, meet the legal test for oppressive conduct under Section 163 of the Companies Act. [JR-10.10, Legal research summary on oppression remedies]

**JR 10.11 - 10.13**
The Applicant’s assertions are denied. The true extent of the transgressions lies with the Applicant and his agents. The funds that cannot be accounted for are those diverted through the fraudulent schemes he has sought to conceal, not the legitimate business expenses he has used as a pretext for this application.

---

## 9. RESPONSE TO AD PARAGRAPHS 11.1 - 11.9: UK COMPANIES

**JR 11.1 - 11.5**
The Applicant’s description of the UK companies is noted. The Second Respondent was indeed appointed to oversee the UK branch and established a profitable e-commerce operation there as well.

**JR 11.6 - 11.9**
The Applicant’s fears are unfounded and speculative. The issues of non-payment and the conduct of the previous UK managing director were known to the Applicant and were being addressed. The Applicant’s attempt to introduce these historic issues as evidence of the Second Respondent’s current misconduct is a diversionary tactic. The financial wellness of the UK operations was transparent and reported, and the Applicant’s feigned ignorance is another misrepresentation.

## 10. RESPONSE TO AD PARAGRAPHS 12.1 - 17.4: INTERDICT, URGENCY, AND EX PARTE APPLICATION

**JR 12.1 - 12.4**
The Applicant's assertion that the orders sought are justified is denied. The application is based on a false narrative and material non-disclosures. The true purpose of this application is not to prevent harm to the corporations but to punish the Second Respondent for exposing fraud and to seize control of the businesses through oppressive means.

**JR 13.1 - 13.2.2**
The Applicant has failed to establish the requirements for an interdict. He has no clear right, as his application is based on falsehoods. The "harm" he alleges was self-inflicted through his own reckless actions, such as cancelling the bank cards. The true harm is that being suffered by the corporations as a result of the Applicant's oppressive conduct and this baseless application.

**JR 13.3 - 13.5**
The Applicant’s apprehension of harm is not reasonable; it is contrived. An alternative adequate remedy was available: a proper investigation of the fraud reported by the Second Respondent, conducted by an independent party, not the conflicted and compromised Mr. Bantjes. The balance of convenience does not favour the granting of the interdict; it favours the dismissal of this application to allow the businesses to resume their profitable operations, free from the Applicant's sabotage.

**JR 13.6 - 13.7**
The Applicant is not entitled to the relief sought. The application is an abuse of process, and I am advised that a punitive costs order against the Applicant is warranted.

**JR 14.1 - 14.5**
The request for a forensic audit is supported, but it must be conducted by a truly independent firm, not one appointed by the Applicant or the conflicted Mr. Bantjes. The audit must cover the full scope of the financial irregularities, including the Villa Via fraud, the R5.4 million stock adjustment, and the R900,000 in unauthorized transfers, not just the legitimate IT expenses the Applicant has used as a smokescreen.

**JR 16.1 - 16.12**
The Applicant has failed to establish grounds for urgency. The alleged discovery of misconduct in mid-June 2025 was followed by a two-month delay before this ex parte application was launched on 19 August 2025. This delay is unexplained. The Applicant created his own urgency by manufacturing a crisis through the cancellation of bank cards and the systematic diversion of revenue. This is not a case of a sudden emergency but a calculated, slow-burning sabotage of the business to create the grounds for a hostile takeover. I am advised that the authorities on self-created urgency will be relied upon in argument. [JR-16.1, Legal research summary on urgency]

**JR 17.1 - 17.4**
The application should not have been brought ex parte. The Applicant’s fear that we would dissipate assets is baseless and unsubstantiated. The true reason for the ex parte approach was to prevent this Honourable Court from hearing the true facts of the matter, namely the Applicant’s material non-disclosures regarding the conflicted and undisclosed trustee, Mr. Bantjes, and the pattern of oppressive conduct that preceded this application. This abuse of the ex parte procedure is a serious matter that warrants the immediate discharge of the order with a punitive costs award. [JR-17.1, Legal research summary on ex parte applications]
