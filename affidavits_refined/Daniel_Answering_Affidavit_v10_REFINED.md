## I, THE UNDERSIGNED

**DANIEL JAMES FAUCITT**

Do hereby make oath and say:

### 1. INTRODUCTION AND CAPACITY

1.1 I am DANIEL JAMES FAUCITT, a major businessman with identity number 820715 5300 18 2, the Second Respondent in this matter.

1.2 I am a Beneficiary of the Faucitt Family Trust (IT 3651/2013). I am also a co-director of RegimA SA (Pty) Ltd (2017/087935/07) and RegimA Worldwide Distribution (Pty) Ltd (2011/005722/07), the latter being the Fourth Respondent.

1.3 The facts herein contained fall within my personal knowledge, unless otherwise stated, and are true and correct.

1.4 Where I make legal submissions, I do so on the advice of my legal representatives.

## 2. PURPOSE OF THIS AFFIDAVIT

2.1 This affidavit is filed in opposition to the Applicant’s founding affidavit and the ex parte order granted on 19 August 2025.

2.2 I am advised and verily believe that the ex parte order was obtained through a series of material non-disclosures, misrepresentations, and an abuse of the Honourable Court’s process. The Applicant has constructed a false narrative to conceal his own and his agents’ misconduct while simultaneously seeking to punish me for exposing it.

2.3 I will address the Applicant’s allegations paragraph by paragraph, following the order of the founding affidavit and using the “AD” numbering for ease of reference.

2.4 The annexures attached hereto are true copies of the originals, and I pray that they be read as if specifically incorporated herein.

## 3. RESPONSE TO AD PARAGRAPHS 1.1 - 3.13: PARTIES AND STRUCTURE

**DR 1.1 - 1.2**
The contents of these paragraphs are noted.

**DR 1.3**
The Applicant’s declaration is noted. I am advised that the commissioning of this affidavit by Mr. Danie Jacobus Bantjes (“Mr. Bantjes”) is a matter of significant legal contention. The Applicant fails to disclose that Mr. Bantjes is a co-trustee of the Faucitt Family Trust and has a direct and substantial financial conflict of interest, facts which are material to this application and which should have been disclosed to the Honourable Court. [DR-1.3, Trust Deed of Faucitt Family Trust; DR-1.4, Loan agreement between Applicant and Mr. Bantjes]

**DR 2.1 - 2.4**
The contents of these paragraphs are noted.

**DR 3.1 - 3.3**
The identification of the Applicant, the First Respondent, and myself is noted.

**DR 3.4.1 & 3.4.2**
The identification of the Third Respondent is noted. The Applicant fails to disclose that this entity owes R1,035,000 to the deceased estate of Kayla Pretorius via Rezonance (Pty) Ltd, a debt which the First Respondent had confronted the Applicant’s agent, Ms. Rynette Farrar (“Ms. Farrar”), about on 15 May 2025. [DR-3.4, Correspondence with Ms. Farrar regarding Rezonance debt]

**DR 3.5.1 & 3.5.2**
The identification of the Fourth Respondent is noted.

**DR 3.6.1 & 3.6.2**
The identification of the Fifth Respondent is noted. This is the entity I identified as being used to commit fraud against the group through the extraction of an 86% profit margin on rent. I reported this fraud in detail to Mr. Bantjes in my capacity as a director on 6 June 2025. [DR-3.6, Report to Mr. Bantjes dated 6 June 2025]

**DR 3.7.1 & 3.7.2**
The identification of the Sixth Respondent is noted. This entity was used to process a fraudulent R5.4 million “stock adjustment” in 2024. In an email regarding a SARS audit, Ms. Farrar claimed she was instructed to make payments related to this adjustment by Mr. Bantjes. [DR-3.7, Email from Ms. Farrar regarding SARS audit]

**DR 3.8 - 3.10**
The identification of the remaining respondents is noted.

**DR 3.11**
The Applicant’s averment is noted. The effect of the order, however, has been to paralyze the legitimate business operations of the Third to Sixth Respondents, causing immense financial harm.

**DR 3.12**
The contents of this paragraph are noted.

**DR 3.13**
The Applicant’s identity confirmation is noted. The commissioning of the affidavit by the conflicted and undisclosed trustee, Mr. Bantjes, is a material non-disclosure that I am advised fatally taints this application.

---

## 4. RESPONSE TO AD PARAGRAPHS 4 & 5: JURISDICTION AND LOCUS STANDI

**DR 4.1**
The Court’s jurisdiction is not in dispute.

**DR 5.1**
The Applicant’s locus standi is noted. However, I am advised that his standing is compromised by the abuse of process and material non-disclosures upon which this application is founded. The Applicant has approached this Court with unclean hands.

---


## 5. RESPONSE TO AD PARAGRAPHS 6.1 - 6.5: RELATIONSHIPS

**DR 6.1**
The Applicant misrepresents the operational control structure. While the First Respondent is a director and member as stated, the financial and operational control of the respondent entities was wielded by the Applicant’s agent, Ms. Farrar, who had sole control over the bank accounts and accounting systems. The Applicant himself had no direct access. [DR-6.1, Affidavit of Ms. Farrar]

**DR 6.2**
I confirm that I am a director of the Third Respondent and a member of the Sixth Respondent.

**DR 6.3**
The Applicant’s statement is noted. It is crucial to add that I personally designed, built, and managed the global e-commerce infrastructure for the respondent entities, which generated approximately R34.9 million in annual revenue. The Applicant’s attempt to erase my contribution is a cornerstone of his false narrative. [DR-6.3, E-commerce revenue reports]

**DR 6.4**
The banking relationships are noted. I reiterate that the Applicant had no access to or control over these accounts; they were managed exclusively by his agent, Ms. Farrar. This fact is critical to understanding the context of the alleged financial irregularities. [DR-6.1, Affidavit of Ms. Farrar]

**DR 6.5**
The registration of the entities with CIPC is noted.

## 6. RESPONSE TO AD PARAGRAPHS 7.1 - 7.20: THE APPLICANT’S FALSE NARRATIVE OF DISCOVERY

**DR 7.1**
This paragraph contains a critical and material non-disclosure. The Applicant presents Mr. Bantjes as an independent accountant who discovered financial irregularities. The truth is that Mr. Bantjes is a co-trustee of the Faucitt Family Trust and is financially beholden to the Applicant, owing him R18.685 million. I had already submitted a detailed report to Mr. Bantjes on **6 June 2025**, exposing serious fraud, including the Villa Via scheme. Mr. Bantjes, in breach of his fiduciary duty as a trustee, dismissed my report and my request for an audit, stating he was “going on holiday.” The Applicant’s narrative of a sudden “discovery” in mid-June is a fabrication designed to conceal the fact that this application is a direct retaliation for my whistleblowing. [DR-1.3, Trust Deed; DR-1.4, Loan Agreement; DR-3.6, Report to Mr. Bantjes dated 6 June 2025]

**DR 7.2 - 7.4**
The “discrepancies” and “irregular payments” were legitimate and necessary expenses for the R34.9 million global e-commerce operation I managed. To describe my conduct as “erratic” is a baseless personal attack. My conduct was that of a diligent director uncovering fraud being perpetrated by the Applicant’s own agents. The Applicant’s attempt to pathologize my professional conduct is a transparent attempt to discredit me as a whistleblower. [DR-6.3, E-commerce revenue reports]

**DR 7.5**
This allegation is false. The payments were fully explained in my report of 6 June 2025. The Applicant’s cancellation of the business bank cards on **7 June 2025** was a punitive and premeditated act of sabotage, occurring the day after I formally exposed the fraud to his conflicted co-trustee, Mr. Bantjes. This was not a reasonable action but a manufactured crisis. [DR-3.6, Report to Mr. Bantjes; DR-7.5, Timeline of events]

**DR 7.6**
This is denied. The Applicant’s claim that transactions remain “unexplained” is false. The reports I provided on 6 June 2025 contained all necessary explanations and supporting documentation available at the time.

**DR 7.7 - 7.9**
The service interruptions were the direct, inevitable, and intended consequence of the Applicant’s own malicious actions. I did not “refuse to assist”; I had already provided the necessary information. The Applicant created a crisis and then blames me for its consequences.

**DR 7.10 - 7.12**
These allegations are denied. The Applicant’s agents, not I, were interfering with the corporations’ staff and operations. My communications were professional and aimed at resolving the crisis the Applicant had created.

**DR 7.13 - 7.15**
My email and system access was revoked in retaliation for exposing the financial misconduct. The selective restoration of access was controlled by Ms. Farrar, acting under the Applicant’s instructions, to further disrupt operations. The conduct that was not in the interests of the corporations was the Applicant’s systematic dismantling of a profitable R34.9 million operation as a means of punishing me.

**DR 7.16 - 7.17**
The First Respondent’s action to obtain new cards was a necessary and responsible step to mitigate the damage caused by the Applicant’s sabotage and prevent the business’s total collapse. She defended my professional and transparent conduct because she was aware of the facts, unlike the version presented to this Court by the Applicant.

**DR 7.18 - 7.20**
I deny receiving a R500,000 “birthday gift.” This is a defamatory and entirely unsupported allegation. The Applicant, through his agents Ms. Farrar and Mr. Bantjes, had full visibility of all financial transactions and would have evidence if such a transfer occurred. No such evidence is presented because it does not exist. Any transfer would have been a legitimate, documented business transaction related to my remuneration, which included performance-based compensation for managing the highly profitable e-commerce division.

## 7. RESPONSE TO AD PARAGRAPHS 8.1 - 17.4: THE APPLICANT’S MISLEADING FINANCIAL ANALYSIS AND ABUSE OF PROCESS

**DR 8.1 - 8.10**
The Applicant’s analysis of IT expenses is fundamentally flawed and misleading. The expenses are presented in a vacuum, divorced from the R34.9 million in revenue they generated. These were not “unexplained” expenses but documented operational costs for a global e-commerce business. The true financial irregularities, which I exposed and the Applicant now seeks to conceal, are the R5.4 million fraudulent stock adjustment, the R900,000 in unauthorized transfers, and the 86% profit extraction via Villa Via. The bank notifications are standard and not indicative of misconduct. [DR-3.6, Report to Mr. Bantjes; DR-3.7, Email from Ms. Farrar; DR-8.4, Bank Statements for RegimA SA]

**DR 9.1 - 9.4**
The Applicant’s summary is an inversion of the truth. The financial misconduct was not the legitimate IT expenses but the fraudulent schemes orchestrated by his own agents. This application is a smokescreen to hide that fraud.

**DR 10.1 - 10.13**
The delinquency application is a vindictive abuse of process. I am advised that the Applicant’s conduct, including the launching of this application based on material non-disclosures and falsehoods, constitutes grounds for a delinquency order against himself under Section 162 of the Companies Act. I have acted at all times in accordance with my fiduciary duties. The allegations of gross abuse, negligence, and fraudulent conduct are a projection of the Applicant’s own actions and those of his agents. The application for a delinquency order is a strategic lawsuit against public participation (SLAPP) suit, designed to silence a whistleblower. [DR-10.1, Legal research summary on delinquency]

**DR 11.1 - 11.9**
The Applicant’s attempt to conflate historic issues in the UK operations with his current false allegations is a red herring. These issues were known and were being managed. They have no bearing on the fabricated grounds for this application.

**DR 12.1 - 12.4**
The orders sought are not justified. They are based on a foundation of lies and are designed to complete the Applicant’s hostile takeover of the businesses, which he initiated through sabotage and revenue diversion.

**DR 13.1 - 13.7**
The Applicant has failed to meet the requirements for an interdict. He has no clear right, the harm was self-inflicted, and he had an adequate alternative remedy: an independent investigation into the fraud I reported. The balance of convenience overwhelmingly favours the dismissal of this application to prevent the final destruction of a profitable business enterprise and the livelihoods of its employees. [DR-13.1, Legal research summary on interdicts]

**DR 14.1 - 14.5**
I support a forensic audit, provided it is conducted by a truly independent firm and its scope includes the fraudulent activities I have identified: the Villa Via scheme, the R5.4 million stock adjustment, the R900,000 in unauthorized transfers, and the diversion of revenue from the respondent companies.

**DR 16.1 - 16.12**
The Applicant has failed to establish urgency. The two-month delay between the alleged “discovery” and the launching of this ex parte application is fatal to his claim of urgency. The urgency was self-created through the Applicant’s own acts of sabotage. This is a textbook case of a party abusing court process by creating a crisis and then demanding emergency relief. [DR-16.1, Legal research summary on urgency]

**DR 17.1 - 17.4**
This application should never have been brought ex parte. The Applicant’s true motive for proceeding without notice was to conceal the material fact of his conflicted, undisclosed co-trustee, Mr. Bantjes, and the history of his own oppressive conduct. This constitutes a gross abuse of the Court’s process and warrants the immediate discharge of the order with a punitive costs award against the Applicant personally. [DR-17.1, Legal research summary on ex parte applications]

---

## 8. CONCLUSION

8.1 I respectfully submit that the Applicant has abused the processes of this Honourable Court by bringing this ex parte application based on a series of material non-disclosures, misrepresentations, and outright falsehoods.

8.2 The application is a retaliatory measure against me for exposing serious financial fraud perpetrated by the Applicant’s own agents and his conflicted, undisclosed co-trustee.

8.3 I pray that this Honourable Court will see through the Applicant’s false narrative, discharge the ex parte order, and award costs against the Applicant on a punitive scale to mark its disapproval of his conduct.
