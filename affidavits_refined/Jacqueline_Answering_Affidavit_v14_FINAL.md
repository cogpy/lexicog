### SECTION 7: Discovery of Financial Irregularities

**JR 7.1** I deny the Applicant's claim that his accountant, Mr. Danie Bantjies, attended the office in mid-June 2025 for provisional tax and VAT submissions. The Second Respondent provided comprehensive reports to Mr. Bantjies on **6 June 2025**, exposing the fraud involving Villa Via Arcadia No 2 CC's excessive profit extraction (86% margin on rent). Mr. Bantjies is the third trustee of the Faucitt Family Trust, a fact concealed from the beneficiaries, and owes the Applicant R18.685 million (Annexure **SF1**).

**JR 7.2** The Applicant's claim that Mr. Bantjies "noted discrepancies" in July 2025 is a misrepresentation. The discrepancies were reported **to** Mr. Bantjies by the Second Respondent on 6 June 2025. The very next day, **7 June 2025**, the Applicant cancelled 15 business credit cards (Annexure **DF4**), demonstrating consciousness of guilt and retaliation for the exposure of fraud.

**JR 7.3** The Applicant mischaracterizes legitimate IT expenses as "irregular payments." These expenses relate to the 51 Shopify stores and associated software infrastructure required to generate **R34.9 million** in annual revenue. The true irregularities are: (1) R5.4 million stock adjustment in Strategic Logistics CC (46% of annual sales); (2) R900,000 unauthorized transfers from RegimA SA; (3) Villa Via's 86% profit margin on rent.

**JR 7.4** The Applicant's characterization of the Second Respondent's conduct as "increasingly erratic" is unfounded and defamatory. The Second Respondent was managing a profitable global e-commerce operation generating R34.9 million annually. His conduct was professional and transparent, as evidenced by his provision of comprehensive reports to Mr. Bantjies on 6 June 2025.

**JR 7.5** [RESPONSE REQUIRED] This paragraph requires a detailed response.

**JR 7.6** The Applicant's claim that "the majority of the transactions remain unexplained" is contradicted by the comprehensive reports provided on 6 June 2025. The Applicant's refusal to accept these explanations was part of the retaliation strategy.

**JR 7.7** I confirm that the Applicant's card cancellations on 7 June 2025 caused service interruptions, including the halting of internet domains and essential business subscriptions. This was the direct and foreseeable consequence of the Applicant's own actions.

**JR 7.8** The Applicant's allegation that the Second Respondent "adopted a 'superior' position and effectively refused to assist" is false. The Second Respondent had already provided comprehensive assistance on 6 June 2025. The Applicant's characterization is an attempt to justify his retaliatory conduct.

**JR 7.9** The inter-office communications referenced by the Applicant (Annexure PF7) demonstrate the Second Respondent's professionalism and the Applicant's unreasonable demands following the card cancellations.

**JR 7.10** The Applicant's communications were with the Second Respondent's personal assistant because the Applicant had already cancelled the business credit cards, creating a crisis that required immediate attention.

**JR 7.11** The Applicant's claim that the Second Respondent "would or could not provide relevant invoices" is contradicted by the comprehensive reports provided on 6 June 2025, which included detailed financial documentation.

**JR 7.12** The Applicant's allegation that the Second Respondent "interfered with the corporations' staff doing their jobs" is an inversion of the facts. The interference came from the Applicant and his agents, who:
- Cancelled 15 business credit cards (7 June 2025)
- Revoked the Second Respondent's email access (retaliation for reporting fraud)
- Diverted company revenue to competing entities owned by Ms. Farrar's son
- Expunged Shopify audit data (22 May 2025)

**JR 7.13** [RESPONSE REQUIRED] This paragraph requires a detailed response.

**JR 7.14** The "continued interference" referenced by the Applicant was the systematic sabotage orchestrated by the Applicant's agents, including:
- Revenue diversion from RegimA SA (from 1 March 2025)
- Revenue diversion from RegimA Worldwide Distribution (from 14 April 2025, Annexure **DF12**)
- Customer diversion to regimaskin.co.za, owned by Ms. Farrar's son (Annexure **JF8**)
- Warehouse sabotage (July 2025, Annexure **DF13**)

**JR 7.15** The conduct "not in the interests of the corporations" was the Applicant's systematic dismantling of a profitable R34.9 million operation in retaliation for the Second Respondent's exposure of fraud.

**JR 7.16** [RESPONSE REQUIRED] This paragraph requires a detailed response.

**JR 7.17** [RESPONSE REQUIRED] This paragraph requires a detailed response.

**JR 7.18** [RESPONSE REQUIRED] This paragraph requires a detailed response.

**JR 7.19** I deny that any transfer was made "without the Applicant's knowledge." As the sole trustee with absolute powers over the Faucitt Family Trust (which owns RegimA Worldwide and Villa Via), and with Ms. Farrar controlling all bank accounts under Mr. Bantjies's instructions, the Applicant had full visibility of all financial transactions.

**JR 7.20** The Applicant's claim that any alleged transfer was "separate to remuneration as director/member" is speculative and unsupported. The Second Respondent's remuneration structure included performance-based compensation for managing the R34.9 million e-commerce operation.

---


### SECTION 8: IT Expenses Analysis

**JR 8.1** The Applicant's claims regarding IT expenses must be viewed in the context of a **R34.9 million** global e-commerce operation. This operation requires a sophisticated and robust IT infrastructure, which the Second Respondent built and managed.

**JR 8.2** The expense categories referenced by the Applicant are standard for a global e-commerce business. This includes 51 Shopify stores, associated software licenses, payment gateways, and marketing platforms.

**JR 8.3** The expense amounts are proportional to the revenue generated. The IT infrastructure was essential to achieving R34.9 million in annual sales.

**JR 8.4** The Applicant misrepresents the timeline of discovery. The Second Respondent discovered and reported the discrepancies to Mr. Bantjies on **6 June 2025**. The Applicant's alleged "discovery" in mid-June was a pretext for retaliation.

**JR 8.5** The investigation was conducted by the conflicted Mr. Bantjies, who had a direct financial interest in concealing the fraud he was involved in. This invalidates any claim of an impartial investigation.

**JR 8.6** The IT vendors referenced are legitimate and well-known providers of e-commerce services, including Shopify, Google, and various software-as-a-service (SaaS) platforms.

**JR 8.7** The Applicant's claim that IT expenses were "unexplained" is false. The Second Respondent provided comprehensive documentation to Mr. Bantjies on 6 June 2025.

**JR 8.8** International payments are a standard and necessary part of a global e-commerce business with customers and suppliers in multiple countries.

**JR 8.9** The bank messages regarding foreign exchange limits are standard notifications and not evidence of misconduct. They are a routine part of international transactions.

**JR 8.10** The true financial irregularities are not the legitimate IT expenses, but the **R5.4 million stock adjustment** in Strategic Logistics CC, the **R900,000 in unauthorized transfers**, and the **86% profit extraction by Villa Via Arcadia No 2 CC**.

---


### SECTION 9: Financial Misconduct Summary

**JR 9.1** The Applicant's summary of financial misconduct is an inversion of the facts, designed to deflect from the actual fraud schemes.

**JR 9.2** The bank message regarding foreign exchange limits is a standard notification, not evidence of misconduct. It is a routine part of international business.

**JR 9.3** The Applicant's summary of "unexplained expenses" is a mischaracterization of legitimate IT costs. The actual misconduct includes:

    **JR 9.3.1** The **R5.4 million stock adjustment** in Strategic Logistics CC, representing 46% of annual sales.

    **JR 9.3.2** The **R900,000 in unauthorized transfers** from RegimA SA's FNB account.

    **JR 9.3.3** The **86% profit margin on rent** charged by Villa Via Arcadia No 2 CC.

**JR 9.4** The total financial impact of the Applicant's and his agents' misconduct is substantial and includes:

    **JR 9.4.1** The **R5.4 million** stock loss in Strategic Logistics CC.

    **JR 9.4.2** The **R900,000** in unauthorized transfers.

    **JR 9.4.3** The **R1,035,000** debt owed to Kayla Pretorius's deceased estate.

    **JR 9.4.4** The ongoing revenue diversion to competing entities.

### SECTION 10: Application to Declare Respondents Delinquent

**JR 10.1** The Applicant's request to have the Second Respondent and me declared delinquent is an abuse of process. Our actions were consistent with our fiduciary duties. It is the Applicant's own conduct that warrants a delinquency declaration under Section 162(5)(c) of the Companies Act, 71 of 2008.

**JR 10.2** The Applicant has: (i) grossly abused his position as a director and trustee; (ii) intentionally or by gross negligence inflicted harm upon the companies; and (iii) acted in a manner that constitutes gross negligence, wilful misconduct, and a breach of trust.

**JR 10.3** The Applicant acted in bad faith and for an improper purpose, in contravention of Section 76(3)(b) of the Companies Act, by manufacturing a crisis to conceal the financial misconduct we had exposed.

**JR 10.4** The Applicant's reliance on the Close Corporations Act is noted. The provisions of this Act, particularly regarding gross negligence and fraud, apply to the Applicant's own conduct.

**JR 10.5** The Applicant's definition of delinquency is noted. The Applicant's conduct meets this definition.

**JR 10.5.1** [RESPONSE REQUIRED] This paragraph requires a detailed response.

**JR 10.5.2** [RESPONSE REQUIRED] This paragraph requires a detailed response.

**JR 10.6** The Applicant's definition of probation is noted. The Applicant's conduct meets this definition.

**JR 10.6.1** [RESPONSE REQUIRED] This paragraph requires a detailed response.

**JR 10.6.2** [RESPONSE REQUIRED] This paragraph requires a detailed response.

**JR 10.6.3** [RESPONSE REQUIRED] This paragraph requires a detailed response.

**JR 10.7** The Applicant invokes breach of fiduciary duty liability. The breaches are established: (1) The Applicant breached fiduciary duty to the Second Respondent (co-director) by unauthorized R900K transfers; (2) The Applicant breached fiduciary duty to beneficiaries (as trustee) by attacking them with interdict; (3) Mr. Bantjies breached fiduciary duty to beneficiaries by dismissing audit request and facilitating fraud.

**JR 10.7.1.1** The Applicant cites liability for loss suffered by corporation. The losses include: (1) R900,000 unauthorized transfers; (2) R5.4M stock "disappeared" from Strategic Logistics; (3) Revenue diversion to competing domain; (4) Card cancellation sabotage; (5) Data expungement.

**JR 10.7.1.2** The Applicant cites liability for economic benefit. The economic benefits derived include: (1) R900,000 unauthorized transfers; (2) R5.4M stock "disappeared" from Strategic Logistics; (3) R1,035,000 owed to Kayla's estate; (4) 86% profit margin on Villa Via rent; (5) Customer diversion to regimaskin.co.za (Adderory).

**JR 10.8** The Applicant invokes Close Corporations Act Section 47 disqualification. This section applies when a member is guilty of gross negligence or fraud. The R5.4M stock adjustment (46% of sales, 10x historical) in Strategic Logistics, with Ms. Farrar claiming Mr. Bantjies instructed the payments, and the same stock type supplied by Adderory, suggests systematic fraud.

**JR 10.9** The Applicant invokes Section 162(5) mandatory disqualification grounds. These grounds apply to the Applicant's conduct: (1) Intentional harm to companies (R34.9M operations destroyed by warehouse sabotage); (2) Grossly negligent harm (card cancellation rendering documentation inaccessible); (3) Breach of trust (trustee attacking beneficiaries).

**JR 10.9.1** The Applicant's reliance on Section 162(5)(a) is noted. This ground applies to the Applicant.

**JR 10.9.2** The Applicant alleges intentional or grossly negligent harm by respondents. The intentional harm was inflicted by the Applicant and his co-conspirators: (1) 6 June: Second Respondent cooperates; (2) 7 June: Cards cancelled; (3) 22 May: Data expunged (7 days after my inquiry); (4) 29 May: Domain stolen (14 days after my inquiry); (5) 8 July: Warehouse sabotaged; (6) 11 Sep: Accounts emptied. Each action followed either my debt inquiry or the Second Respondent's fraud exposure.

**JR 10.9.3** The Applicant alleges gross negligence or misconduct. The gross negligence is demonstrated by: Cancelling 15 business cards without notice, rendering documentation inaccessible, then complaining about missing documentation. This demonstrates consciousness of guilt and bad faith.

**JR 10.9.3.1** The Applicant alleges wilful misconduct. The wilful misconduct includes: (1) Systematic revenue diversion (1 Mar, 14 Apr); (2) Data destruction (22 May); (3) Domain theft (29 May); (4) Card sabotage (7 June); (5) Warehouse sabotage (8 July); (6) Account emptying (11 Sep). This six-month campaign occurred after I investigated fraud and the Second Respondent exposed fraud.

**JR 10.9.3.2** The Applicant alleges acquiescence to fraud. The acquiescence to fraud includes: (1) Two years of unallocated expenses while Ms. Farrar controlled systems using the Applicant's email and Linda was employed as bookkeeper; (2) R5.4M stock "disappeared" with Mr. Bantjies allegedly instructing payments; (3) R1,035,000 debt to Kayla's estate unpaid since Feb 2023; (4) Villa Via 86% profit margin rent extraction.

**JR 10.9.3.3** The Applicant alleges omission with fraudulent purpose. The omissions with fraudulent purpose include: (1) Applicant omitted Mr. Bantjies's trustee status from affidavit; (2) Applicant omitted Mr. Bantjies's R18.685M debt; (3) Applicant omitted R34.9M revenue context for IT expenses; (4) Applicant omitted UK → SA payment flow (claimed opposite); (5) Applicant omitted timeline showing card cancellation day after Second Respondent's cooperation; (6) Applicant omitted my debt inquiry and subsequent retaliation.

**JR 10.10** The Applicant seeks probation under Section 162(7). This section applies when conduct is oppressive or unfairly prejudicial. The oppressive conduct includes: (1) I fulfilled fiduciary duty by investigating debt, then was punished with interdict; (2) Second Respondent exposed fraud to accountant, then suffered six-month sabotage campaign; (3) Both excluded from profitable businesses we built.

**JR 10.10.1** The Applicant alleges conduct inconsistent with duties. The conduct inconsistent with duties includes: (1) Trustee attacking beneficiaries (Applicant, Mr. Bantjies); (2) Director making unauthorized transfers (Applicant); (3) Trustee dismissing fraud investigation (Mr. Bantjies); (4) Accountant facilitating fraud while being debtor (Mr. Bantjies); (5) Administrator controlling systems while diverting revenue (Ms. Farrar).

**JR 10.10.2** The Applicant invokes Section 162(a)(iii) grounds for probation.

**JR 10.10.2.1** The Applicant alleges conduct with prejudicial result. The prejudicial results include: (1) I was excluded from companies after investigating fraud; (2) Second Respondent excluded from R34.9M operations he built; (3) Customers diverted to competing domain owned by Ms. Farrar's son; (4) R900K transferred without authorization; (5) R5.4M stock "disappeared"; (6) R1,035,000 owed to Kayla's estate unpaid.

**JR 10.10.2.2** The Applicant alleges oppressive business conduct. The oppressive conduct includes: (1) Ms. Farrar controlled all systems using Applicant's email while claiming to act under Mr. Bantjies's instructions; (2) Applicant had no access to email, bank accounts, or accounting systems; (3) Two years of expenses unallocated despite employed bookkeeper; (4) Mr. Bantjies (Trustee + Debtor + Accountant) dismissed fraud investigation.

**JR 10.10.2.3** The Applicant alleges oppressive exercise of powers. The oppressive exercise of powers includes: (1) Applicant used trustee powers to attack beneficiaries; (2) Mr. Bantjies used trustee powers to dismiss audit request and facilitate fraud; (3) Applicant used director powers to make unauthorized R900K transfers; (4) Applicant used court process to obtain ex parte order based on material non-disclosures.

**JR 10.11** The Applicant's requested remedies are inappropriate. The appropriate remedy is a full, independent forensic audit.

**JR 10.12** The Court's discretion should be exercised against the Applicant due to his abuse of process and material non-disclosures.

**JR 10.13** The Applicant alleges unaccounted money. The unaccounted money includes: (1) R900,000 unauthorized transfers (14-15 Feb 2025); (2) R5.4 million stock "disappeared" from Strategic Logistics; (3) R1,035,000 owed to Kayla's estate since Feb 2023; (4) R1.73 million transferred 11 Sep 2025; (5) Two years of unallocated expenses dumped into RegimA Worldwide on 30 Mar 2025.

---


### SECTION 11: UK Operations

**JR 11.1** The Applicant's statement that "we also began companies in the United Kingdom" is misleading. The UK e-commerce operations were built and funded by RegimA Zone Ltd (UK company 10697009), which is owned and operated by the Second Respondent.

**JR 11.2** The Applicant's claim that these companies "fall under the UK head office, being RegimA UK Ltd" is false. RegimA Zone Ltd is an independent entity, not under RegimA UK Ltd.

**JR 11.3** The Applicant's statement regarding directors is noted. The operational control and funding of RegimA Zone Ltd rests with the Second Respondent.

**JR 11.4** The Applicant's claim of "minimal involvement" is accurate. The Applicant had no operational involvement in the UK e-commerce operations built by the Second Respondent.

**JR 11.5** The Applicant's statement that the Second Respondent "was appointed to oversee the UK branch" is misleading. The Second Respondent built and owns RegimA Zone Ltd independently.

**JR 11.6** The Applicant's claim that "the third to sixth respondents ship to the UK branch, but do not receive payment therefrom" is a complete inversion of the facts. UK bank records show that RegimA Zone Ltd continuously paid for the South African Shopify platforms (Annexure **DF8**). This directly contradicts the Applicant's perjurious claims that the UK entities were indebted to the SA companies.

**JR 11.7** The Applicant's reference to Isaac Chesno and alleged fraud is irrelevant to the current matter and appears designed to create a false narrative of UK financial problems.

**JR 11.8** The Applicant's statement that he fears "the continued non-payment (from the UK branch) may inter alia be a ruse" is contradicted by bank records showing continuous UK → SA payments (Annexure **DF8**).

**JR 11.9** The Applicant's claim that he has "no idea pertaining to the financial wellness of the UK branches" is inconsistent with his role as trustee with absolute powers. This statement appears designed to create a pretext for further interference with the Second Respondent's UK operations.

### SECTION 17: Ex Parte Basis

**JR 17.1** I deny the Applicant's allegation and state that his purported "fear" is neither reasonable nor well-founded. It is, in fact, a self-serving and misleading justification for bringing this application on an ex parte basis, predicated on a significant material non-disclosure. The transfer of R500,000.00 was not a "defiant" act of misappropriation but a necessary and urgent operational payment made to cover immediate business expenses and creditor payments for the e-commerce operation that generates R34.9 million in annual revenue. This transfer was made necessary precisely because the Applicant, in his own "knee jerk reaction," had unilaterally and without warning cancelled 15 business credit cards on 7 June 2025, thereby crippling the companies' ability to meet their financial obligations. The Applicant materially misleads this Honourable Court by omitting the critical context: his fear of a "knee jerk reaction" is a projection of his own conduct. The Second Respondent provided the Applicant's accountant and fellow Trustee, Mr. Danie Bantjies, with comprehensive reports detailing financial misconduct on 6 June 2025. The very next day, the Applicant retaliated by cancelling the credit cards, manufacturing the very crisis he now uses to justify urgency. The Applicant's fear is therefore not based on any conduct of the Respondents, but on a situation he deliberately engineered. This is a classic application of the doctrine of *venire contra factum proprium*—the Applicant cannot be allowed to benefit from a predicament of his own making.

**JR 17.2** I deny in the strongest terms that the Respondents have any intention of concealing or destroying documentation. The Applicant's alleged "reason to believe" is baseless and constitutes another material non-disclosure to this Honourable Court. The Applicant's claim is directly contradicted by the facts. On 6 June 2025, the Second Respondent, acting with full transparency, provided the Applicant's own accountant, Mr. Bantjies, with comprehensive financial reports, analyses, and supporting evidence. This act is the very antithesis of concealing or destroying documentation. The Applicant fails to disclose to this Court that the Respondents have been the party providing information, while the Applicant and his associates have been the party obfuscating it. The request for an Anton Piller-style order is not a measure to preserve evidence, but a punitive and tactical maneuver designed to harass the Respondents and seize control of the business operations under a false pretext. The Respondents have at all times acted to preserve the integrity of the companies' financial records, as it is this very evidence that exposes the misconduct which the Applicant now seeks to conceal through this urgent application.

**JR 17.3** While we acknowledge the legal principle that certain applications may be brought ex parte, the Applicant's reliance on this principle is misplaced and abusive in these circumstances. An applicant approaching the court on an ex parte basis is held to the highest standard of good faith (*uberrima fides*), a duty the Applicant has manifestly failed to discharge. The Applicant has approached this Court with unclean hands, having concealed a series of material facts, any one of which should have been sufficient to persuade the Court not to grant relief without notice to the Respondents. These non-disclosures include: (a) Mr. Bantjies's Triple Conflict of Interest—The Applicant failed to disclose that his confirmatory witness, Mr. Bantjies, is not an independent accountant but is simultaneously: (i) a co-Trustee of the Faucitt Family Trust, (ii) a significant debtor to the Applicant (to the sum of R18.685 million), and (iii) the accountant for the very entities he was supposedly investigating. Furthermore, Mr. Bantjies acted as the Commissioner of Oaths for the Applicant's own affidavit, a shocking breach of legal and ethical standards. (b) The True Timeline of Events—The Applicant concealed that the alleged "discovery" of irregularities in July was false. The Second Respondent had already reported the misconduct to Mr. Bantjies on 6 June 2025, and the Applicant's subsequent card cancellations on 7 June 2025 were a direct, retaliatory response. (c) The Self-Created Urgency—The Applicant failed to disclose that the entire basis for urgency was a direct consequence of his own actions in sabotaging the companies' financial operations. The "obvious reasons" for an ex parte application do not apply when the applicant's case is built on a foundation of misrepresentation and material non-disclosure. The Applicant is not protecting the companies from the Respondents; he is protecting himself from the evidence the Respondents have compiled.

**JR 17.4** I deny that the matter is urgent, and I specifically deny that there was any legitimate basis for it to be heard ex parte. The entire premise of urgency is a fabrication constructed by the Applicant to mislead this Honourable Court. The urgency was self-created. Any disruption to the business operations of the Third to Sixth Respondents was the direct and foreseeable result of the Applicant's decision to cancel the business credit cards on 7 June 2025. This act of sabotage, undertaken a single day after receiving detailed reports of financial misconduct, was the sole cause of the subsequent operational difficulties. The Applicant's true motive was not to prevent financial harm, but to launch a pre-emptive strike against the Respondents to prevent them from taking further action based on the fraud they had uncovered. This application is not a shield to protect the companies, but a sword to attack the whistleblowers. Therefore, the ex parte order was obtained through a gross abuse of the process of this Court, founded on material non-disclosures and a false narrative of urgency. We respectfully submit that the order must be set aside on this basis alone.

---

## CONCLUSION

I respectfully submit that the Applicant's allegations are unfounded and that this application should be dismissed with costs.
