The First Respondent stated that keeping them would be "profiting from the proceeds of murder." This confrontation will prove significant. [JR-3.2, Daniel's identification and role documentation]

[JR-3.6.1, RegimA Worldwide company registration and directorship records]
**JR 3.6.2**

[JR-3.7.2, Strategic Logistics company registration and directorship records]
**JR 3.8**

*Seventh Respondent - FirstRand Bank (FNB)* FNB holds accounts for the companies.

The account opened with R997,597.94 and closed at R5,284.08 within one month, despite 169 customer deposits totaling R566,598.57 proving active trade. [JR-3.8, Villa Via company registration and directorship records]
**JR 3.9**

**JR 6.1**

*Relationships Between Parties* The Applicant describes family and corporate relationships. The evidence shows a different control structure: Rynette controlled all bank accounts (The Applicant had no access), controlled the Sage accounting system using The Applicant's email (pete@regima.com), and claimed to act under Bantjies's instructions rather than The Applicant's. Rynette's sister Linda was employed as bookkeeper, yet two years of expenses remained unallocated until 30 March 2025. [JR-6.1, Kayla Pretorius estate documentation and debt records]

*Directors and Members of Respondent Entities* The Applicant describes directorships. Key facts: The First Respondent and The Second Respondent are co-directors of RegimA SA and RegimA Worldwide Distribution (RWD). RWD is owned by the Faucitt Family Trust. On 30 March 2025, Rynette and The Applicant dumped two years of unallocated expenses into RWD and demanded The Second Respondent sign off within 12 hours for SARS VAT and Annual Accounts. The Second Respondent used this deadline extension (until 6 June) to finalize reports and uncover the Villa Via fraud. [JR-6.3, Rynette Farrar employment and control documentation]

**JR 7.1**

The "accountant" is Danie Jacobus Bantjies of Bantjes and Company. What Peter fails to disclose is that Bantjies is an undisclosed trustee of the Faucitt Family Trust, owes R18.685M to the trust (payout schedule: May 2026, 2027, 2029), and gave instructions to Rynette for multi-million rand transactions. Daniel exposed Villa Via fraud to Bantjies on June 6, 2025. Bantjies dismissed Daniel's audit request on June 10, 2025, claiming he was "going on holiday."

*Domain and Service Halts Due to Card Cancellations* The Applicant claims subscriptions were halted due to card cancellations. To prevent business collapse, The Second Respondent substituted his personal card (1927) for RegimA SA and The First Respondent her personal card (3212) for RegimA Zone. Meanwhile, the competing domain regimaskin.co.za was actively diverting customers. [JR-7.13, Card cancellation records (June 7, 2025) and impact documentation]

*Son's Interference with Business Operations* The Applicant alleges The Second Respondent interfered with operations. The evidence shows The Second Respondent built and managed 51+ Shopify stores generating R34.9 million annually. The Second Respondent's partner Kayla Pretorius co-built these operations before her murder on 13 July 2023. After Kayla's death, a court order was obtained to seize her email account (kayp@rzo.io), which interfered with a law enforcement investigation that had instructed a freeze on the account.

Peter claims R6,738,007.47 in IT expenses for 2024 are "almost entirely unexplainable." This deliberately omits critical context: these expenses supported 51+ Shopify stores generating R34.9 million annually (RegimA SA: 25 stores, R8.5M turnover; RegimA Zone: 26 stores, R26.4M turnover). When contextualized, the IT expenses represent 19.3% of revenue - reasonable operational costs for a global e-commerce platform. [JR-8.4, IT expenses 2024 (R6.7M) with revenue context (R34.9M annual operations, 19.3% ratio)]
**JR 8.5**

Peter claims R2,116,159.47 in IT expenses for 2025 are unexplainable. These expenses represent 6.1% of the R34.9M annual revenue - well within reasonable operational costs for e-commerce operations. Peter deliberately omitted the revenue context to create a misleading impression of excessive spending. [JR-8.5, IT expenses 2025 (R2.1M) with revenue context (R34.9M annual operations, 6.1% ratio)]
**JR 8.6**

Peter alleges payments are unexplained, but fails to disclose that Rynette controlled the accounting system using Peter's email (pete@regima.com), and that two years of expenses remained unallocated despite Rynette's sister Linda being employed as bookkeeper and Bantjies serving as accountant. The question is: Why were expenses unallocated for two years if these professionals were performing their duties? [JR-8.6, Shopify operations overview (51+ stores, R34.9M revenue breakdown)]

*Probation Relief Under Section 162* The Applicant seeks probation under Section 162. This section requires consideration of conflicts of interest. The evidence reveals: Bantjies (Trustee + Debtor + Accountant) commissioned this affidavit as Commissioner of Oaths. Bantjies had R18.685M reasons to prevent discovery of the fraud The Second Respondent reported. [JR-10.5.2, Daniel's cooperation documentation (June 6 fraud exposure to Bantjies)]
**JR 10.6.1**

*Member's Duty to Manage in Corporation's Interest* The Applicant cites duty to manage in corporation's interest. The R5.4M stock adjustment in Strategic Logistics represents 46% of annual sales—10 times the historical adjustment. Rynette claimed Bantjies instructed the payments. This transaction was not in Strategic Logistics' interest. [JR-10.6.1, Villa Via fraud analysis (86% profit margin on rent)]
**JR 10.6.2**

*Member's Duty Not to Exceed Powers* The Applicant cites duty not to exceed powers. The unauthorized R900,000 transfers from RegimA SA (14-15 Feb 2025) were made without The Second Respondent's authority as co-director. The Applicant exceeded his powers by acting unilaterally. [JR-10.6.2, Strategic Logistics R5.4M stock adjustment documentation]
**JR 10.6.3**

*Member's Duty to Avoid Conflicts of Interest* The Applicant cites duty to avoid conflicts. The evidence reveals multiple conflicts: (1) Bantjies: Trustee + Debtor + Accountant; (2) Rynette's son (Adderory) supplying stock to RegimA Skin Treatments while same stock type "disappeared" from Strategic Logistics; (3) Villa Via (trust-owned) charging 86% profit margin rent to group; (4) Regimaskin.co.za (owned by Rynette's son) competing with RegimA operations.

**JR 12.1**

*UK Branch Non-Payment and Fraud Concerns* The Applicant alleges UK branch non-payment and fraud. The Shopify invoices (DF5-DF7) prove the opposite: UK entities funded SA operations to the tune of R84,661+ annually. UK bank transactions corroborate the invoices. The Applicant's statement is demonstrably false—perjury. [JR-12.1, RegimA Zone UK bank statements proving UK → SA payment flow]
**JR 12.2**

*Misappropriation Leading to Insolvency Risk* The Applicant alleges misappropriation leading to insolvency. The actual insolvency risk was created by: (1) R900K unauthorized transfers; (2) Revenue diversions (1 Mar, 14 Apr); (3) Data expungement (22 ); (4) Card cancellation (7 June); (5) Warehouse sabotage (8 July); (6) Account emptying (11 Sep). Despite six months of sabotage, The Second Respondent was still managing to pay creditors until the accounts were emptied. [JR-12.2, Shopify invoices showing R84,661+ annual UK → SA funding]
**JR 12.3**

*Purpose of Court Application* The Applicant states the purpose is to prevent further harm. The actual purpose: (1) Punish The First Respondent for investigating R1,035,000 debt (15 ); (2) Punish The Second Respondent for exposing Villa Via fraud (6 June); (3) Seize control of R34.9M operations The Second Respondent built; (4) Prevent forensic audit that would expose Bantjies's conflicts and the systematic fraud. [JR-12.3, Daniel's personal card statements for UK business funding]
**JR 12.4**

*Alternative Roles for Wife and Son* The Applicant suggests alternative roles for The First Respondent and The Second Respondent. The evidence shows: (1) The First Respondent fulfilled trustee duties by investigating fraud; (2) The Second Respondent built and managed R34.9M profitable operations; (3) Both were systematically sabotaged after investigating/exposing fraud; (4) Both were attacked with interdict by co-trustees The Applicant and Bantjies; (5) The First Respondent was included in interdict two days after signing "Main Trustee" document. --- ### RESPONSE TO AD PARAGRAPHS STARTING WITH 13 [JR-12.4, UK company ownership documentation (Daniel, not Peter or trust)]

**JR 13.2.2**

*Injury Sustained and Apprehension of Further Harm* The Applicant claims injury and apprehension of harm. The Applicant suffered no injury he didn't inflict on himself: (1) Card cancellation rendered documentation inaccessible; (2) Unauthorized transfers depleted accounts; (3) Revenue diversions reduced cash flow; (4) Warehouse sabotage destroyed operations. The apprehension of further harm was manufactured to justify ex parte relief. [JR-13.2.2, Jacqueline's CEO role and operational essentiality documentation]
**JR 13.3**

*Reasonable Apprehension of Irreparable Harm* The Applicant claims reasonable apprehension of irreparable harm. The irreparable harm was inflicted by The Applicant's six-month sabotage campaign: (1) R34.9M operations destroyed (93.3% revenue collapse); (2) Customer relationships diverted to competing domain; (3) Audit data expunged (100% loss); (4) Documentation rendered inaccessible; (5) Accounts emptied. The Second Respondent and The First Respondent suffered irreparable harm, not The Applicant. [JR-13.3, RegimA Skin Treatments 33-year history and awards]
**JR 13.4**

*Interdicts Essential for Corporation Survival* The Applicant claims interdicts essential for survival. The corporations were profitable under The Second Respondent's management (R34.9M annually). The survival threat came from The Applicant's sabotage: (1) Unauthorized transfers; (2) Revenue diversions; (3) Data destruction; (4) Card cancellations; (5) Warehouse sabotage; (6) Account emptying. Excluding The Second Respondent and The First Respondent threatened survival, not ensured it. [JR-13.4, UK Responsible Person certification and regulatory requirements]
**JR 13.5**

*Balance of Convenience Favours Granting Relief* The Applicant claims balance of convenience favors relief. The balance overwhelmingly favors The Second Respondent and The First Respondent: (1) They built and managed profitable operations; (2) They investigated and exposed fraud; (3) They were systematically sabotaged for doing so; (4) They substituted personal cards to prevent business collapse; (5) They support independent forensic audit. The Applicant obtained relief through material non-disclosures and false statements. [JR-13.5, Daily operational damage assessment from interdict]

*Financial Constraints on Respondents* The Applicant seeks financial constraints on The First Respondent and The Second Respondent. The financial constraints were already imposed through sabotage: (1) R900K unauthorized transfers; (2) Revenue diversions; (3) Data expungement; (4) Card cancellations; (5) Warehouse sabotage; (6) Account emptying. Despite six months of sabotage, The Second Respondent was still managing to pay creditors. [JR-14.1, Financial constraints caused by Peter's actions documentation]
**JR 14.2**

The contents of this paragraph are noted. [Add specific response and annexure citation if required]
**JR 14.3**

*Constraint to Prevent Financial Prejudice* The Applicant seeks constraints to prevent prejudice. The prejudice was inflicted by The Applicant: (1) RegimA SA account opened R997,597.94, closed R5,284.08 (Feb-Mar 2025); (2) 169 customer deposits R566,598.57 proving active trade; (3) R1.73M transferred 11 Sep 2025; (4) R34.9M operations destroyed by warehouse sabotage. [JR-14.3, Revenue diversion records (March 1 and April 14, 2025)]
**JR 14.4**

*Forensic Audit Necessity and Remuneration* The Applicant seeks forensic audit. The Second Respondent and The First Respondent support independent forensic audit by impartial party. Such audit would reveal: (1) Bantjies's conflicts (Trustee + Debtor + Accountant); (2) R5.4M stock transfer pricing scheme (SLG → Adderory → RST); (3) R1,035,000 debt to Kayla's estate; (4) Two years unallocated expenses; (5) Unauthorized R900K transfers; (6) Revenue diversion scheme; (7) Rynette's control of systems using The Applicant's email. [JR-14.4, Daniel's creditor payment records despite sabotage]
**JR 14.5**

*Request for Relief Under Part B* The Applicant requests Part B relief. The relief should include: (1) Setting aside ex parte order obtained through material non-disclosures; (2) Independent forensic audit; (3) Investigation of Bantjies's conflicts; (4) Investigation of R5.4M stock "disappearance"; (5) Recovery of R1,035,000 owed to Kayla's estate; (6) Investigation of Rynette's control and Adderory's role; (7) Consideration of The Applicant's delinquency under Section 162(5). --- ### RESPONSE TO AD PARAGRAPHS STARTING WITH 16 [JR-14.5, Account emptying justification analysis]
**JR 16.1**

*Discovery of Respondents' Conduct* The Applicant claims discovery of conduct in mid-June 2025. The actual discovery: (1) 15 : The First Respondent discovered R1,035,000 debt to Kayla's estate; (2) 6 June: The Second Respondent exposed Villa Via fraud to Bantjies; (3) 7 June: The Applicant cancelled cards (day after The Second Respondent's cooperation); (4) 10 June: Bantjies dismissed audit request. The Applicant's "discovery" was actually consciousness of guilt after The Second Respondent exposed fraud to Bantjies. [JR-16.1, Daniel's fraud exposure to Bantjies (June 6, 2025)]
**JR 16.2**

*R600,000 Transfer as Trigger for Action* The Applicant cites R600,000 transfer (later corrected to R500,000) as trigger. The actual triggers: (1) 15 : The First Respondent confronted Rynette about R1,035,000 debt and "profiting from proceeds of murder"; (2) 6 June: The Second Respondent exposed Villa Via fraud to Bantjies (unknowingly to perpetrator); (3) 10 June: Bantjies dismissed audit request. The R500,000 transfer is a pretext. [JR-16.2, Bantjies's audit dismissal (June 10, 2025)]

**JR 16.5**

*Unawareness of Urgent Application Process* The Applicant claims unawareness of urgent process. The Applicant had access to legal advice and Bantjies as Commissioner of Oaths. The delay from mid-June to August contradicts urgency. The actual urgency: preventing forensic audit that would expose Bantjies's conflicts and systematic fraud. [JR-16.5, 67-day delay analysis (June 6 to August 13)]

*Delay Would Have Been Avoided* The Applicant claims delay would have been avoided if he knew the process. The two-month delay (mid-June to August) contradicts urgency. The timing suggests: (1) Waiting to see if The Second Respondent's audit request would proceed; (2) Coordinating with Bantjies (who dismissed audit request 10 June); (3) Preparing The First Respondent's punishment (included in interdict 13 Aug, two days after signing "Main Trustee" document 11 Aug).

*State of Shock and Delayed Response* The Applicant claims state of shock. The Applicant was not in shock—he was executing a systematic sabotage campaign: (1) 14-15 Feb: R900K unauthorized transfers; (2) 1 Mar: Revenue diversion started; (3) 30 Mar: Expense dumping; (4) 14 Apr: Bank letter for revenue diversion; (5) 7 Jun: Card cancellation; (6) 8 Jul: Warehouse sabotage; (7) 11 Sep: Account emptying. This is not shock—this is systematic execution. [JR-16.8, Peter's discovery timeline vs Daniel's fraud exposure]

*Need for Urgent Court Assistance* The Applicant claims need for urgent assistance. The Applicant had alternative remedies: (1) Trustee with "additional powers" as Founder; (2) have conducted audit as trustee; (3) have consulted with co-trustee The First Respondent (instead, he attacked her); (4) have consulted with co-trustee Bantjies (who was facilitating the fraud). The Applicant chose ex parte process to avoid disclosure of Bantjies's conflicts and systematic sabotage. --- ### RESPONSE TO AD PARAGRAPHS STARTING WITH 17 [JR-16.12, Systematic sabotage pattern documentation]

*Ex Parte Basis for Application* The Applicant justifies ex parte application. The ex parte process was abused through material non-disclosures: (1) Bantjies's trustee status; (2) Bantjies's R18.685M debt; (3) Timeline manipulation (card cancellation day after cooperation); (4) UK payment flow perjury (claimed SA → UK, actually UK → SA); (5) R34.9M revenue context omission; (6) The First Respondent's debt inquiry and retaliation pattern; (7) The Second Respondent's fraud exposure and retaliation pattern; (8) Rynette's control of The Applicant's email; (9) Adderory's competing domain; (10) R5.4M stock "disappearance."

**JR 17.4**

*Urgency Justifies Ex Parte Relief* The Applicant claims urgency justifies ex parte relief. The urgency was manufactured: (1) Two-month delay contradicts urgency; (2) Card cancellation day after cooperation shows consciousness of guilt; (3) Systematic sabotage from Feb-Sep shows premeditation; (4) The First Respondent included two days after signing document shows coordination; (5) Alternative remedies available as trustee. The ex parte relief was obtained to prevent The Second Respondent and The First Respondent from exposing the material non-disclosures and systematic fraud. --- ### RESPONSE TO AD PARAGRAPHS STARTING WITH 18 [JR-17.4, Venire contra factum proprium analysis (Peter's card cancellations creating the problem)]
