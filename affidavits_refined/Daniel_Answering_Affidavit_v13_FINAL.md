### SECTION 7: Discovery of Financial Irregularities

**DR 7.1** I confirm that I provided comprehensive reports to Mr. Bantjies on **6 June 2025**, exposing the fraud involving Villa Via Arcadia No 2 CC. Mr. Bantjies, as the Applicant's accountant and a concealed trustee, had a duty to investigate these claims. Instead, he dismissed my request for an audit.

**DR 7.2** The Applicant's claim that discrepancies were "noted" in July is false. I reported them on 6 June 2025. The Applicant's immediate cancellation of 15 business credit cards on **7 June 2025** was a direct act of retaliation and sabotage.

**DR 7.3** The IT expenses were legitimate and necessary for the R34.9 million e-commerce operation I built. The true irregularities, which I reported, were the R5.4 million stock adjustment, the R900,000 unauthorized transfers, and Villa Via's 86% profit extraction.

**DR 7.4** My conduct was professional and transparent. I built a profitable global business. The Applicant's characterization of my conduct as "erratic" is a self-serving attempt to justify his retaliatory actions.

**DR 7.5** [RESPONSE REQUIRED] The Applicant states: "The payments in question could not be explained by my wife and son, and I, accordingly, cancelled their business bank cards (and my own, for the sake ..." This paragraph requires a detailed response.

**DR 7.6** The Applicant's claim that transactions remain "unexplained" is false. The reports I provided on 6 June 2025 contained all necessary explanations.

**DR 7.7** The service interruptions were a direct and foreseeable consequence of the Applicant's own actions.

**DR 7.8** The Applicant's allegation that I "refused to assist" is false. I had already provided comprehensive assistance on 6 June 2025.

**DR 7.9** The communications in Annexure PF7 demonstrate my professionalism in the face of the Applicant's manufactured crisis.

**DR 7.10** The communications with my personal assistant were necessary because the Applicant had created a crisis that required immediate attention.

**DR 7.11** The Applicant's claim that I "would or could not provide relevant invoices" is contradicted by the comprehensive reports I provided on 6 June 2025.

**DR 7.12** The interference came from the Applicant and his agents, who systematically sabotaged the business operations.

**DR 7.13** [RESPONSE REQUIRED] The Applicant states: "Upon the domains and the like being re-instated through payment, our son elected not to provide all employees/staﬀ access to their historic emails and..." This paragraph requires a detailed response.

**DR 7.14** The "continued interference" was a systematic campaign of sabotage orchestrated by the Applicant's agents.

**DR 7.15** The conduct "not in the interests of the corporations" was the Applicant's dismantling of a profitable R34.9 million operation.

**DR 7.16** [RESPONSE REQUIRED] The Applicant states: "My wife simply re-approached the banks (being the seventh and eighth respondents) and obtained duplicate/new cards, on or about 24 June 2025." This paragraph requires a detailed response.

**DR 7.17** [RESPONSE REQUIRED] The Applicant states: "I discussed the transactions with her, but she rejected any idea of malfeasance or neglect on our son's part. 7.18-7.20 THE R500,000 PAYMENT" This paragraph requires a detailed response.

**DR 7.18** [RESPONSE REQUIRED] The Applicant states: "She adopted an 'I will show you' approach, defended our son, and then transferred to him the sum of R500,000.00 from the corporations, on or about 16 ..." This paragraph requires a detailed response.

**DR 7.19** The Applicant had full visibility of all financial transactions through his agents, Ms. Farrar and Mr. Bantjies.

**DR 7.20** My remuneration included performance-based compensation for managing the R34.9 million e-commerce operation.
