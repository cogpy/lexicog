### SECTION 7: Discovery of Financial Irregularities

**DR 7.1** I confirm that I provided comprehensive reports to Mr. Bantjies on **6 June 2025**, exposing the fraud involving Villa Via Arcadia No 2 CC. Mr. Bantjies, as the Applicant's accountant and a concealed trustee, had a duty to investigate these claims. Instead, he dismissed my request for an audit.

**DR 7.2** The Applicant's claim that discrepancies were "noted" in July is false. I reported them on 6 June 2025. The Applicant's immediate cancellation of 15 business credit cards on **7 June 2025** was a direct act of retaliation and sabotage.

**DR 7.3** The IT expenses were legitimate and necessary for the R34.9 million e-commerce operation I built. The true irregularities, which I reported, were the R5.4 million stock adjustment, the R900,000 unauthorized transfers, and Villa Via's 86% profit extraction.

**DR 7.4** My conduct was professional and transparent. I built a profitable global business. The Applicant's characterization of my conduct as "erratic" is a self-serving attempt to justify his retaliatory actions.

**DR 7.5** [RESPONSE REQUIRED] This paragraph requires a detailed response.

**DR 7.6** The Applicant's claim that transactions remain "unexplained" is false. The reports I provided on 6 June 2025 contained all necessary explanations.

**DR 7.7** The service interruptions were a direct and foreseeable consequence of the Applicant's own actions.

**DR 7.8** The Applicant's allegation that I "refused to assist" is false. I had already provided comprehensive assistance on 6 June 2025.

**DR 7.9** The communications in Annexure PF7 demonstrate my professionalism in the face of the Applicant's manufactured crisis.

**DR 7.10** The communications with my personal assistant were necessary because the Applicant had created a crisis that required immediate attention.

**DR 7.11** The Applicant's claim that I "would or could not provide relevant invoices" is contradicted by the comprehensive reports I provided on 6 June 2025.

**DR 7.12** The interference came from the Applicant and his agents, who systematically sabotaged the business operations.

**DR 7.13** [RESPONSE REQUIRED] This paragraph requires a detailed response.

**DR 7.14** The "continued interference" was a systematic campaign of sabotage orchestrated by the Applicant's agents.

**DR 7.15** The conduct "not in the interests of the corporations" was the Applicant's dismantling of a profitable R34.9 million operation.

**DR 7.16** [RESPONSE REQUIRED] This paragraph requires a detailed response.

**DR 7.17** [RESPONSE REQUIRED] This paragraph requires a detailed response.

**DR 7.18** [RESPONSE REQUIRED] This paragraph requires a detailed response.

**DR 7.19** The Applicant had full visibility of all financial transactions through his agents, Ms. Farrar and Mr. Bantjies.

**DR 7.20** My remuneration included performance-based compensation for managing the R34.9 million e-commerce operation.

**DR 8.9** The bank messages regarding foreign exchange limits are standard notifications.

### SECTION 9: Financial Misconduct Summary

**DR 9.2** The bank message is a standard notification, not evidence of misconduct.

### SECTION 17: Ex Parte Basis

**DR 17.1** I confirm the contents of JR 17.1 and add the following facts. The Applicant's stated "fear" is disingenuous and is contradicted by the objective evidence. The R500,000.00 transfer was not a "misappropriation" but a critical operational payment required to maintain business continuity. On 7 June 2025, the Applicant cancelled 15 business credit cards (**Annexure DF4**), which were essential for paying international suppliers, software subscriptions, and hosting for the 51 e-commerce stores that generate R34.9 million in annual revenue. The transfer was a desperate measure to cover these immediate, legitimate, and verifiable business expenses. The Applicant's claim of a "knee jerk reaction" is a deliberate inversion of the truth. I personally delivered comprehensive financial reports to his accountant, Mr. Bantjies, on **6 June 2025**. The Applicant's cancellation of all credit cards occurred the very next day, on **7 June 2025**. This timeline establishes that the Applicant's action was the actual "knee jerk reaction" to the exposure of the financial misconduct detailed in my reports. The Applicant's fear is therefore not based on any rational assessment of risk, but is a self-serving narrative designed to conceal his own retaliatory conduct and to mislead this Honourable Court as to the true cause of the operational crisis.

**DR 17.2** I confirm the contents of JR 17.2. The Applicant's assertion that he has "reason to believe" we would conceal or destroy documentation is a baseless and malicious falsehood. My actions prove the opposite. I am the one who compiled, preserved, and presented evidence of financial misconduct. On **6 June 2025**, I provided Mr. Bantjies with detailed reports, spreadsheets, and supporting documents. I have meticulously archived all financial data, communications, and system logs. My conduct has been one of total transparency and a commitment to preserving the evidentiary record. The request for an Anton Piller-type order is not a protective measure, but a hostile tactic. The true purpose is to seize the very evidence that I have compiled against the Applicant and his associates, and to disrupt my ability to continue managing the business and uncovering further misconduct. It is a transparent attempt to turn the tables on the whistleblower. I have a vested interest in the preservation of all documentation, as it is this documentation that will ultimately vindicate me and expose the truth. The Applicant's claim is devoid of any factual foundation and should be dismissed as the tactical maneuver that it is.

**DR 17.3** I confirm the contents of JR 17.3 and wish to underscore the extent of the material non-disclosures upon which this ex parte application was founded. The Applicant failed to disclose to this Honourable Court that his key witness, Mr. Danie Bantjies, who provided a confirmatory affidavit, is hopelessly conflicted. The Applicant did not disclose that: (a) Mr. Bantjies is a co-Trustee of the Faucitt Family Trust alongside the Applicant; (b) Mr. Bantjies is a significant personal debtor to the Applicant, owing him R18.685 million as per **Annexure SF1**; (c) Mr. Bantjies was the Commissioner of Oaths for the Applicant's founding affidavit, a fundamental breach of the requirement for an independent commissioner. The Applicant presented a false timeline to the Court. He failed to disclose that he was in possession of my detailed financial reports from **6 June 2025**, and that his cancellation of the credit cards on **7 June 2025** was a direct response to those reports. He created a false impression of a recent discovery of wrongdoing in July to manufacture a sense of urgency. These are not minor omissions; they are profound misrepresentations that go to the very heart of the matter. The Applicant has fundamentally breached his duty of *uberrima fides* to this Court, and the ex parte order was granted on the basis of a deliberately incomplete and misleading set of facts.

**DR 17.4** I confirm the contents of JR 17.4. The claim of urgency is a fabrication, and the evidence demonstrates that the crisis was entirely self-created by the Applicant. There was no operational urgency prior to 7 June 2025. The e-commerce businesses were functioning and profitable, generating R34.9 million in annual revenue under my management. The urgency arose as a direct and immediate consequence of the Applicant's decision to cancel 15 business credit cards on 7 June 2025. This single act crippled the companies' ability to pay for essential services, including web hosting, software subscriptions, and international suppliers. The resulting disruption was not only foreseeable but, I submit, intended. The timeline is irrefutable: I delivered reports exposing misconduct on **June 6th**. The Applicant retaliated by sabotaging the company's financial infrastructure on **June 7th**. He then approached the Court citing the very chaos he had engineered as the basis for urgent relief. This is a flagrant abuse of the court process. The matter was not urgent in the legal sense, as the Applicant had ample opportunity to address his purported concerns through ordinary legal channels. He chose not to do so, instead opting for a manufactured crisis to justify an ex parte application designed to dispossess the Respondents of control and evidence. The ex parte order, having been obtained on this false premise, must be discharged.

---

## CONCLUSION

I respectfully submit that the Applicant's allegations are unfounded and that this application should be dismissed with costs.
