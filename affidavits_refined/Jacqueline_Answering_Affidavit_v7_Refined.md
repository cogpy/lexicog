## I, THE UNDERSIGNED

**JACQUELINE FAUCITT**

do hereby make oath and state that:

---

### 1. INTRODUCTION AND CAPACITY

1.1. I am the First Respondent in this matter, an adult female South African citizen.

1.2. I am a Trustee and a Beneficiary of the Faucitt Family Trust (IT 3651/2013). I am also a co-director of RegimA SA (Pty) Ltd (2017/087935/07) and RegimA Worldwide Distribution (Pty) Ltd (2011/005722/07), both of which are owned by the Faucitt Family Trust.

1.3. The facts contained in this affidavit are within my personal knowledge and belief, unless the context indicates otherwise, and are to the best of my knowledge true and correct.

1.4. Where I make legal submissions, I do so on the advice of my legal representatives, and I believe them to be correct.

---

### 2. PURPOSE OF THIS AFFIDAVIT

2.1. This affidavit is filed in opposition to the Applicant's founding affidavit and the ex parte order granted against me and the Second Respondent on 19 August 2025.

2.2. I respectfully submit that the ex parte order was obtained through material non-disclosures, misrepresentation of facts, and an abuse of the court process. I therefore seek to have the order set aside.

2.3. In this affidavit, I will address the Applicant's allegations in the order they appear in his founding affidavit, corresponding to the paragraph numbers (AD paragraphs) used therein.

---

### 3. RESPONSE TO AD PARAGRAPHS 1-3.13: PARTIES AND STRUCTURE

#### AD 1 - Director Liability for Breach of Fiduciary Duty

3.1. The Applicant invokes legal provisions concerning a director's liability for breach of fiduciary duty. It is noteworthy that the accounting system central to the Applicant's allegations was controlled by Ms. Rynette Farrar, who operated it using the Applicant's own email address (pete@regima.com), as evidenced by Sage screenshots (Annexure **SF2**). The Applicant himself had no access to this system.

#### AD 1.3 - Applicant's Personal Details and Declaration

3.2. The Applicant's personal details are noted. The founding affidavit was commissioned by Mr. Danie Jacobus Bantjies, identified merely as "our accountant." The evidence will reveal the full, conflicted extent of Mr. Bantjies's roles.

#### AD 2 - Company Business Conduct Requirements

3.3. The Applicant alleges reckless or grossly negligent business conduct. The financial performance of the companies proves the contrary. The Second Respondent and his late partner, Ms. Kayla Pretorius, built a global e-commerce operation of over 51 Shopify stores generating R34.9 million annually. The businesses were highly profitable under the Second Respondent's management.

#### AD 2.4 - Parties to the Application - Introduction

3.4 The Applicant introduces the parties. The corporate structure reveals that certain entities are owned by the Faucitt Family Trust, which has three trustees. Two are identified in the founding affidavit: the Applicant and myself. The third trustee's identity was not disclosed to the beneficiaries until recently.

#### AD 3 - Court Order for Probation of Directors/Members

3.5. The Applicant seeks probation orders under Section 162 of the Companies Act, 71 of 2008. This section requires a court to consider, inter alia, conflicts of interest. The evidence will show that the accountant who allegedly "discovered" the irregularities, Mr. Bantjies, has multiple undisclosed and conflicting roles.

#### AD 3.2 - Respondents - Wife

3.6. I am the First Respondent. On 15 May 2025, I confronted Ms. Rynette Farrar regarding a debt of R1,035,000 owed by RegimA Skin Treatments CC to Rezonance (Pty) Ltd since February 2023 (Annexure **JF2**). These funds form part of the deceased estate of Ms. Pretorius. I warned Ms. Farrar that retaining these funds was unconscionable. This confrontation was a catalyst for the retaliatory actions that followed.

#### AD 3.4 - Respondents - Son

3.7. The Second Respondent is my son. On 6 June 2025, he cooperated with the Applicant's request to provide comprehensive reports to the accountant, Mr. Bantjies. These reports detailed financial misconduct concerning Villa Via Arcadia No 2 CC, an entity owned by the Faucitt Family Trust (Annexure **DF3**). The Second Respondent had unknowingly reported fraud to a conflicted and undisclosed trustee.

#### AD 3.4.2 - Third Respondent - RegimA Skin Treatments

3.8. RegimA Skin Treatments CC owes R1,035,000 to Rezonance (Pty) Ltd, part of Ms. Pretorius's deceased estate, since February 2023. When I raised this debt on 15 May 2025, Ms. Farrar falsely claimed it had been paid. This entity receives stock from Adderory (Pty) Ltd, a company owned by Ms. Farrar's son (Annexure **SF5**), indicating a pattern of related-party transactions.

#### AD 3.6 - Fourth Respondent - Regim A UK

3.9. The UK e-commerce operations are owned and funded by RegimA Zone Ltd (UK company 10697009). UK bank records show this entity continuously paid for the South African Shopify platforms (Annexure **DF8**). This directly contradicts the Applicant's later perjurious claims that the UK entities were indebted to the SA companies.

#### AD 3.6.1 - Fifth Respondent - Villa Via Arcadia No 2 CC

3.10 Villa Via Arcadia No 2 CC (1996/004451/23) is owned by the Faucitt Family Trust. Financial analysis reveals an 86% profit margin on rent charged to the group—an excessive profit extraction (Annexure **DF2**). This was the fraud the Second Respondent reported to the accountant on 6 June 2025.

#### AD 3.6.2 - Windeed Printout Evidence for Villa Via Arcadia

3.11 Property registration confirms trust ownership. The trust has three trustees, but only two were known to the beneficiaries at the time of this application.

#### AD 3.7 - Sixth Respondent - Strategic Logistics CC

3.12. Strategic Logistics CC recorded a R5.4 million stock adjustment in 2024, representing 46% of its annual sales and a tenfold increase from the prior year (Annexure **SF3**). The stock type matches inventory supplied by Adderory (Pty) Ltd (owned by Ms. Farrar's son) to RegimA Skin Treatments, suggesting a related-party transaction designed to extract funds.

#### AD 3.7.2 - Windeed Printout Evidence for Strategic Logistics

3.13 Property registration documents are noted. In a SARS audit email concerning the R5.4M stock adjustment, Ms. Farrar claimed that Danie Bantjies instructed her to make the substantial payments related to this transaction (Annexure **SF4**).

#### AD 3.8 - Seventh Respondent - FirstRand Bank (FNB)

3.14 FNB holds accounts for the companies. On 14 and 15 February 2025, unauthorized transfers of R450,000 each (R900,000 total) were made from RegimA SA's FNB account without the Second Respondent's authority as co-director (Annexure **DF9**). The account opened with R997,597.94 and closed at R5,284.08 within one month, despite 169 customer deposits totaling R566,598.57 proving active trade (Annexure **DF10**, **DF11**).

#### AD 3.9 - Eighth and Ninth Respondents

3.15 ABSA Bank and CIPC are cited. Revenue diversion for RegimA Worldwide Distribution began with an ABSA bank letter dated 14 April 2025 (Annexure **DF12**).

#### AD 3.11 - Reference to Respondents as Wife and Son

3.16. The Applicant's references are noted. As beneficiaries and, in my case, a co-trustee of the Faucitt Family Trust, we have a right to ensure the trust is managed in accordance with the Trust Property Control Act, 57 of 1988 ("TPCA"). Section 9(1) of the TPCA requires trustees to act with care, diligence, and skill. The Applicant has breached this duty.

#### AD 3.13 - Court Jurisdiction and Identity Confirmation

3.17. Jurisdiction is confirmed. The Applicant's affidavit was commissioned by Mr. Bantjies. The Applicant fails to disclose that Mr. Bantjies is also the third trustee of the Faucitt Family Trust and a significant debtor to the Applicant, owing R18.685 million (Annexure **SF1**). This constitutes a material non-disclosure and a severe conflict of interest.

---

### 4. RESPONSE TO AD PARAGRAPH 4: ACCOUNTANT'S CONFLICT OF INTEREST

#### AD 4 - Accountant Details - Bantjes and Company

4.1. The Applicant identifies his accountant as Mr. Bantjies, who allegedly investigated financial discrepancies in mid-June 2025. The Applicant fails to disclose the following material facts regarding Mr. Bantjies's conflicting roles:

    4.1.1. **Trustee:** Mr. Bantjies is the third trustee of the Faucitt Family Trust, a fact concealed from the beneficiaries.

    4.1.2. **Debtor:** Mr. Bantjies owes the Applicant R18.685 million (Annexure **SF1**).

    4.1.3. **Company Controller:** Mr. Bantjies was admittedly "running the companies" when the Second Respondent reported fraud to him.

    4.1.4. **Obstruction of Investigation:** Mr. Bantjies dismissed the Second Respondent's request for an independent audit on 10 June 2025.

    4.1.5. **Financial Authority:** Ms. Farrar stated Mr. Bantjies instructed the payment of multi-million rand amounts, including the R5.4M stock adjustment (Annexure **SF4**).

4.2. This confluence of roles—Trustee, Debtor, Accountant, and de facto Financial Director—creates an irreconcilable and impermissible conflict of interest. This conflict, undisclosed to the Court, invalidates any claim of an impartial investigation and constitutes a breach of the fiduciary duties stipulated in Section 9(1) of the TPCA.

---

### 5. RESPONSE TO AD PARAGRAPHS 6.1-6.5: CORPORATE STRUCTURE

#### AD 6.1 - Relationships Between Parties

5.1. The Applicant misrepresents the operational control structure. Evidence shows Ms. Farrar controlled all bank accounts and the Sage accounting system (using the Applicant's email, pete@regima.com), and claimed to act under Mr. Bantjies's instructions (Annexures **SF2**, **SF4**). The Applicant had no direct access to these systems.

#### AD 6.3 - Directors and Members of Respondent Entities

5.2. The Applicant describes directorships. As co-director of RegimA SA (Pty) Ltd, I can confirm that on 14 and 15 February 2025, R900,000 was transferred from the company's account without my authority (Annexure **DF9**). Furthermore, on 30 March 2025, two years of unallocated expenses were improperly consolidated into RegimA Worldwide Distribution (Pty) Ltd with a demand for my sign-off within 12 hours (Annexure **DF14**).

#### AD 6.5 - Banking and Registration of Respondent Entities

5.3. The Applicant's description of banking arrangements omits the systematic revenue diversion orchestrated by his agents. This pattern included: (1) diversion of RegimA SA revenue from 1 March 2025; (2) diversion of RegimA Worldwide Distribution revenue via an ABSA bank letter dated 14 April 2025; (3) expungement of Shopify audit data on 22 May 2025; (4) cancellation of 15 business credit cards on 7 June 2025; and (5) the transfer of R1.73M from company accounts on 11 September 2025 (Annexure **DF12**).

---

### 6. RESPONSE TO AD PARAGRAPHS 7-7.20: URGENCY AND ALLEGED MISCONDUCT

#### AD 7 - Urgency and Delay Considerations

6.1. The Applicant's claim of urgency is contradicted by the two-month delay between the alleged discovery of misconduct in mid-June 2025 and the filing of this application in August 2025. The actual triggers for this application were my confrontation with Ms. Farrar on 15 May 2025 and the Second Respondent's exposure of fraud on 6 June 2025.

#### AD 7.3 - Urgency Details

6.2. The Applicant claims his accountant noted discrepancies in mid-June 2025. This is a misrepresentation. On 6 June 2025, the Second Respondent provided his reports to Mr. Bantjies. The very next day, 7 June 2025, the Applicant cancelled 15 business credit cards essential to the operations (Annexure **DF4**). The crisis was therefore manufactured by the Applicant himself. He is estopped from complaining of a situation he created (*venire contra factum proprium*).

#### AD 7.6 - Financial Impact of Misconduct

6.3. The Applicant alleges financial impact from my conduct. The evidence demonstrates that the financial sabotage was orchestrated by the Applicant and his agents. This includes: R900,000 in unauthorized transfers (February 2025); revenue diversion (from March 2025); Shopify data expungement (May 2025); domain theft (May 2025); card cancellations (June 2025); and warehouse sabotage (July 2025) (Annexures **DF9**, **DF12**, **JF4**, **DF4**, **DF13**).

#### AD 7.8 - Continuing Harm to Corporations

6.4. The harm to the corporations was inflicted by the Applicant's agents. An email dated 20 June 2025 confirms an employee was instructed to divert customers from the established `regima.zone` domain to `regimaskin.co.za` (Annexure **JF8**). This competing domain is owned by Adderory (Pty) Ltd, a company owned by Ms. Farrar's son, thereby diverting revenue away from the Respondent entities.

#### AD 7.10 & 7.13 - Card Cancellations and Service Interruptions

6.5. The Applicant complains of service interruptions that were the direct and foreseeable consequence of his own action of cancelling the 15 business credit cards on 7 June 2025. The Second Respondent was compelled to use his personal credit cards to prevent a total collapse of the business.

#### AD 7.16, 7.18, 7.20 - Alleged Interference

6.6. The Applicant's allegations of interference are unfounded. The Second Respondent was managing a profitable R34.9M-per-annum global e-commerce operation. The interference came from the Applicant and his agents, who systematically dismantled the business after the Second Respondent exposed financial misconduct. His access to email and accounting systems was revoked in retaliation for his reporting of these irregularities.

---

### 7. RESPONSE TO AD PARAGRAPHS 8.4-9.3: FINANCIAL DISCREPANCIES

#### AD 8.4 & 8.5 - Discovery of Financial Discrepancies

7.1. The Applicant misrepresents the timeline of discovery. The Second Respondent discovered and reported the discrepancies to Mr. Bantjies on 6 June 2025. The Applicant's alleged "discovery" in mid-June was a pretext for retaliation. Furthermore, the investigation was conducted by the conflicted Mr. Bantjies, who had a direct financial interest in concealing the fraud.

#### AD 8.7 & 8.10 - IT and International Expenses

7.2. The Applicant mischaracterizes legitimate and necessary operational expenses for a global e-commerce business as "unexplained." These expenses relate to the 51 Shopify stores and associated software required to generate R34.9 million in annual revenue. The true financial irregularities are the R5.4 million stock adjustment in Strategic Logistics CC and the two years of unallocated expenses.

#### AD 9.2 & 9.3 - Financial Misconduct Summary

7.3. The Applicant's summary of financial misconduct is an inversion of the facts. The bank message regarding foreign exchange limits is a standard notification, not evidence of misconduct. The actual misconduct includes the R5.4M stock adjustment, the R900,000 in unauthorized transfers, and the excessive profit extraction by Villa Via Arcadia No 2 CC.

---

### 8. RESPONSE TO AD PARAGRAPHS 10.1-10.14: DELINQUENCY ALLEGATIONS

8.1. The Applicant's request to have the Second Respondent and me declared delinquent is an abuse of process. Our actions were consistent with our fiduciary duties. It is the Applicant's own conduct that warrants a delinquency declaration under Section 162(5)(c) of the Companies Act, 71 of 2008.

8.2. The Applicant has: (i) grossly abused his position as a director and trustee; (ii) intentionally or by gross negligence inflicted harm upon the companies; and (iii) acted in a manner that constitutes gross negligence, wilful misconduct, and a breach of trust.

8.3. The Applicant acted in bad faith and for an improper purpose, in contravention of Section 76(3)(b) of the Companies Act, by manufacturing a crisis to conceal the financial misconduct we had exposed.

#### AD 10.7 - Member Liability for Breach of Fiduciary Duty

8.9 The Applicant invokes breach of fiduciary duty liability. The breaches are established: (1) The Applicant breached fiduciary duty to the Second Respondent (co-director) by unauthorized R900K transfers; (2) The Applicant breached fiduciary duty to beneficiaries (as trustee) by attacking them with interdict; (3) Mr. Bantjies breached fiduciary duty to beneficiaries by dismissing audit request and facilitating fraud.

#### AD 10.7.1.1 - Liability for Loss Suffered by Corporation

8.10 The Applicant cites liability for loss suffered by corporation. The losses include: (1) R900,000 unauthorized transfers; (2) R5.4M stock "disappeared" from Strategic Logistics; (3) Revenue diversion to competing domain; (4) Card cancellation sabotage; (5) Data expungement.

#### AD 10.7.1.2 - Economic Benefit Derived by Member

8.10A The Applicant cites liability for economic benefit. The economic benefits derived include: (1) R900,000 unauthorized transfers; (2) R5.4M stock "disappeared" from Strategic Logistics; (3) R1,035,000 owed to Kayla's estate; (4) 86% profit margin on Villa Via rent; (5) Customer diversion to regimaskin.co.za (Adderory).

#### AD 10.8 - Disqualification for Misconduct Under Section 47

8.12 The Applicant invokes Close Corporations Act Section 47 disqualification. This section applies when a member is guilty of gross negligence or fraud. The R5.4M stock adjustment (46% of sales, 10x historical) in Strategic Logistics, with Ms. Farrar claiming Mr. Bantjies instructed the payments, and the same stock type supplied by Adderory, suggests systematic fraud.

8.13 The Applicant seeks delinquency declaration. The evidence supports declaring the Applicant delinquent under Section 162(5): (1) Intentional harm to companies (systematic sabotage); (2) Grossly negligent conduct (card cancellation without notice); (3) Breach of trust (attacking beneficiaries as trustee); (4) Abuse of process (ex parte order based on material non-disclosures and false statements).

#### AD 10.9 - Mandatory Disqualification Under Section 162(5)

8.14 The Applicant invokes Section 162(5) mandatory disqualification grounds. These grounds apply to the Applicant's conduct: (1) Intentional harm to companies (R34.9M operations destroyed by warehouse sabotage); (2) Grossly negligent harm (card cancellation rendering documentation inaccessible); (3) Breach of trust (trustee attacking beneficiaries).

#### AD 10.9.2 - Intentional or Grossly Negligent Harm

8.15 The Applicant alleges intentional or grossly negligent harm by respondents. The intentional harm was inflicted by the Applicant and his co-conspirators: (1) 6 June: Second Respondent cooperates; (2) 7 June: Cards cancelled; (3) 22 May: Data expunged (7 days after my inquiry); (4) 29 May: Domain stolen (14 days after my inquiry); (5) 8 July: Warehouse sabotaged; (6) 11 Sep: Accounts emptied. Each action followed either my debt inquiry or the Second Respondent's fraud exposure.

#### AD 10.9.3 - Manner of Acting - Gross Negligence or Misconduct

8.16 The Applicant alleges gross negligence or misconduct. The gross negligence is demonstrated by: Cancelling 15 business cards without notice, rendering documentation inaccessible, then complaining about missing documentation. This demonstrates consciousness of guilt and bad faith.

#### AD 10.9.3.1 - Gross Negligence or Wilful Misconduct

8.17 The Applicant alleges wilful misconduct. The wilful misconduct includes: (1) Systematic revenue diversion (1 Mar, 14 Apr); (2) Data destruction (22 May); (3) Domain theft (29 May); (4) Card sabotage (7 June); (5) Warehouse sabotage (8 July); (6) Account emptying (11 Sep). This six-month campaign occurred after I investigated fraud and the Second Respondent exposed fraud.

#### AD 10.9.3.2 - Acquiescence to Fraudulent Acts

8.18 The Applicant alleges acquiescence to fraud. The acquiescence to fraud includes: (1) Two years of unallocated expenses while Ms. Farrar controlled systems using the Applicant's email and Linda was employed as bookkeeper; (2) R5.4M stock "disappeared" with Mr. Bantjies allegedly instructing payments; (3) R1,035,000 debt to Kayla's estate unpaid since Feb 2023; (4) Villa Via 86% profit margin rent extraction.

#### AD 10.9.3.3 - Party to Omission with Fraudulent Purpose

8.19 The Applicant alleges omission with fraudulent purpose. The omissions with fraudulent purpose include: (1) Applicant omitted Mr. Bantjies's trustee status from affidavit; (2) Applicant omitted Mr. Bantjies's R18.685M debt; (3) Applicant omitted R34.9M revenue context for IT expenses; (4) Applicant omitted UK → SA payment flow (claimed opposite); (5) Applicant omitted timeline showing card cancellation day after Second Respondent's cooperation; (6) Applicant omitted my debt inquiry and subsequent retaliation.

#### AD 10.10 - Probation Under Section 162(7)

8.20 The Applicant seeks probation under Section 162(7). This section applies when conduct is oppressive or unfairly prejudicial. The oppressive conduct includes: (1) I fulfilled fiduciary duty by investigating debt, then was punished with interdict; (2) Second Respondent exposed fraud to accountant, then suffered six-month sabotage campaign; (3) Both excluded from profitable businesses we built.

#### AD 10.10.1 - Conduct Materially Inconsistent with Duties

8.21 The Applicant alleges conduct inconsistent with duties. The conduct inconsistent with duties includes: (1) Trustee attacking beneficiaries (Applicant, Mr. Bantjies); (2) Director making unauthorized transfers (Applicant); (3) Trustee dismissing fraud investigation (Mr. Bantjies); (4) Accountant facilitating fraud while being debtor (Mr. Bantjies); (5) Administrator controlling systems while diverting revenue (Ms. Farrar).

#### AD 10.10.2 - Grounds Under Section 162(a)(iii)

8.22 The Applicant invokes Section 162(a)(iii) grounds for probation.

#### AD 10.10.2.1 - Conduct with Oppressive or Prejudicial Result

8.23 The Applicant alleges conduct with prejudicial result. The prejudicial results include: (1) I was excluded from companies after investigating fraud; (2) Second Respondent excluded from R34.9M operations he built; (3) Customers diverted to competing domain owned by Ms. Farrar's son; (4) R900K transferred without authorization; (5) R5.4M stock "disappeared"; (6) R1,035,000 owed to Kayla's estate unpaid.

#### AD 10.10.2.2 - Business Conducted in Oppressive Manner

8.24 The Applicant alleges oppressive business conduct. The oppressive conduct includes: (1) Ms. Farrar controlled all systems using Applicant's email while claiming to act under Mr. Bantjies's instructions; (2) Applicant had no access to email, bank accounts, or accounting systems; (3) Two years of expenses unallocated despite employed bookkeeper; (4) Mr. Bantjies (Trustee + Debtor + Accountant) dismissed fraud investigation.

#### AD 10.10.2.3 - Powers Exercised in Oppressive Manner

8.25 The Applicant alleges oppressive exercise of powers. The oppressive exercise of powers includes: (1) Applicant used trustee powers to attack beneficiaries; (2) Mr. Bantjies used trustee powers to dismiss audit request and facilitate fraud; (3) Applicant used director powers to make unauthorized R900K transfers; (4) Applicant used court process to obtain ex parte order based on material non-disclosures.

#### AD 10.13 - Unaccounted Money - Significant Sums

8.26 The Applicant alleges unaccounted money. The unaccounted money includes: (1) R900,000 unauthorized transfers (14-15 Feb 2025); (2) R5.4 million stock "disappeared" from Strategic Logistics; (3) R1,035,000 owed to Kayla's estate since Feb 2023; (4) R1.73 million transferred 11 Sep 2025; (5) Two years of unallocated expenses dumped into RegimA Worldwide on 30 Mar 2025.

8.27 The Applicant claims full extent not yet determined. The full extent includes: (1) Mr. Bantjies's undisclosed trustee status; (2) Mr. Bantjies's R18.685M debt; (3) Ms. Farrar's control of Applicant's email; (4) Ms. Farrar's son's competing domain; (5) Adderory's stock supply relationship; (6) R5.4M stock transfer pricing scheme; (7) Court order seizing Kayla's email during law enforcement investigation.

---

### 9. RESPONSE TO AD PARAGRAPHS 11.2-12.4: UK OPERATIONS

9.1. The Applicant's claims regarding the UK operations are perjurious. He alleges that UK entities are indebted to the South African companies.

9.2. The evidence proves the opposite. RegimA Zone Ltd (UK), established by the Second Respondent and his late partner, owns and funds the global Shopify platform. Bank records confirm that the UK entity consistently paid for the Shopify subscriptions for the SA entities, with payments exceeding R84,661 annually (Annexures **DF5-DF8**).

9.3. The Applicant's false statements are a deliberate attempt to mislead the Court and create a pretext for seizing control of the profitable UK-based operations.

---

### 10. RESPONSE TO AD PARAGRAPHS 13.2-13.8: INTERDICT REQUIREMENTS

10.1. The Applicant has failed to establish the requirements for interdictory relief. He has no clear right, the harm was self-inflicted, and the balance of convenience favours the Respondents.

10.2. **No Clear Right:** The Applicant's right is vitiated by his own misconduct, including the unauthorized transfer of R900,000 and the manufacturing of a crisis to justify this application. He obtained the ex parte order through material non-disclosures.

10.3. **No Irreparable Harm:** The harm alleged was a direct consequence of the Applicant's own sabotage campaign. The irreparable harm was suffered by the Respondents, whose R34.9M-per-annum business was destroyed.

10.4. **Balance of Convenience:** The balance of convenience overwhelmingly favours the Respondents, who acted to protect the business while the Applicant acted to destroy it.

---

### 11. RESPONSE TO AD PARAGRAPHS 14.1-14.5: FORENSIC AUDIT

11.1. The Applicant’s request for a forensic audit is supported, provided it is conducted by a truly independent and impartial firm. The Second Respondent and I have consistently advocated for such an audit.

11.2. An independent audit would confirm the timeline of malfeasance and expose the full extent of the financial prejudice inflicted upon the companies by the Applicant and his agents. This includes the R5.4M stock adjustment, the R900,000 in unauthorized transfers, the diversion of revenue, and the excessive profit extraction by Villa Via Arcadia No 2 CC.

---

### 12. RESPONSE TO AD PARAGRAPHS 16.1-16.12: URGENCY

12.1. The Applicant's claim of urgency is baseless and contradicted by his own timeline. The two-month delay between the alleged discovery of misconduct and the filing of this application is evidence of a lack of urgency.

12.2. The true motivation for this application was to retaliate against the Second Respondent and me for exposing financial misconduct. The Applicant's claim of being in a "state of shock" is disingenuous, as the evidence reveals a premeditated and systematic campaign of sabotage against the companies.

---

### 13. RESPONSE TO AD PARAGRAPHS 17.3-17.4: EX PARTE APPLICATION

13.1. The Applicant's resort to an ex parte application was a calculated abuse of process designed to mislead the Court and prevent the Respondents from exposing the truth. The application was replete with material non-disclosures, including the conflicted roles of Mr. Bantjies, the true nature of the UK financial arrangements, and the timeline of events.

13.2. The manufactured urgency was a pretext to obtain a tactical advantage and continue the campaign of economic sabotage against the Respondents.

---

### 14. RESPONSE TO REMAINING ALLEGATIONS

14.1. The Applicant's remaining allegations are a continuation of the same pattern of misrepresentation and non-disclosure. The evidence demonstrates that the unauthorized transfers, financial irregularities, and operational sabotage were all orchestrated by the Applicant and his agents in retaliation for our attempts to expose their misconduct.

---

### 15. PRAYER

WHEREFORE I pray for an order in the following terms:

1. That the ex parte order granted on 19 August 2025 be set aside.
2. That the Applicant’s application be dismissed with costs on an attorney and client scale.
3. That the Applicant be declared a delinquent director in terms of Section 162(5) of the Companies Act, 71 of 2008.
4. That an independent forensic auditor be appointed to investigate the financial affairs of the companies and the conduct of the Applicant and his agents.
5. Further and/or alternative relief.
