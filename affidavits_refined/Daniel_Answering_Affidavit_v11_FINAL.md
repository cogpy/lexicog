## END OF AFFIDAVIT


## RESPONSES TO UNCOVERED PARAGRAPHS

### RESPONSE TO AD PARAGRAPHS STARTING WITH 1

**DR 1**  
*Director Liability for Breach of Fiduciary Duty*  
The Applicant invokes director liability provisions. The affidavit will reveal that the accounting system used to track these alleged breaches was controlled by Rynette Farrar using The Applicant's email address (pete@regima.com), as evidenced by Sage screenshots from June and August 2025. The Applicant himself had no access to this system.

**DR 1.3**  
*Applicant's Personal Details and Declaration*  
The Applicant provides his ID (520430 5708 18 5) and address. The affidavit is commissioned by The Second Respondentie Bantjies, identified as "our accountant." Bantjies's full role will progressively emerge through the document.

### RESPONSE TO AD PARAGRAPHS STARTING WITH 2

**DR 2**  
*Company Business Conduct Requirements*  
The Applicant alleges reckless or grossly negligent business conduct. The actual financial performance shows The Second Respondent and Kayla built 51+ Shopify stores generating R34.9 million annually. RegimA SA: 25 stores, R8.5M turnover. RegimA Zone: 26 stores, R26.4M turnover. The businesses were highly profitable under The Second Respondent's management.

**DR 2.4**  
*Parties to the Application - Introduction*  
The Applicant introduces the parties. The corporate structure will reveal that certain entities are owned by the Faucitt Family Trust (IT 3651/2013), which has three trustees. Two are identified in this affidavit: The Applicant and The First Respondent. The third trustee's identity was not disclosed to the beneficiaries.

---

### RESPONSE TO AD PARAGRAPHS STARTING WITH 3

**DR 3**  
*Court Order for Probation of Directors/Members*  
The Applicant seeks probation orders. The Companies Act Section 162 requires consideration of conflicts of interest. The evidence will show that the accountant who "discovered" the alleged irregularities has multiple undisclosed roles.

**DR 3.2**  
*Respondents - Wife*  
The First Respondent is identified as The Applicant's wife and First Respondent. On 15 May 2025, The First Respondent confronted Rynette Farrar about a R1,035,000 debt owed by RegimA Skin Treatments to Rezonance since February 2023. These funds were part of Kayla Pretorius's estate. The First Respondent stated that keeping them would be "profiting from the proceeds of murder." This confrontation will prove significant.

**DR 3.4**  
*Respondents - Son*  
The Second Respondent is identified as The Applicant's son and Second Respondent. On 6 June 2025, The Second Respondent cooperated with The Applicant's request by providing comprehensive reports to the accountant regarding Villa Via Arcadia, which is owned by the Faucitt Family Trust. The Second Respondent unknowingly reported fraud to one of the perpetrators.

**DR 3.4.2**  
*Third Respondent - RegimA Skin Treatments*  
RegimA Skin Treatments CC (B1992/005371/23) owes R1,035,000 to Rezonance (Kayla's estate) since February 2023. When The First Respondent raised this debt on 15 May 2025, Rynette claimed it was paid—a false statement. RegimA Skin Treatments receives stock from Adderory (Pty) Ltd, a company owned by Rynette's son.

**DR 3.6**  
*Fourth Respondent - Regim A UK*  
RegimA Zone Ltd (UK company 10697009) owns and funds the Shopify platforms. UK bank transactions show continuous Shopify payments. This contradicts claims that will appear later in the affidavit about UK entities owing money to SA operations.

**DR 3.6.1**  
*Fifth Respondent - Villa Via Arcadia No 2 CC*  
Villa Via Arcadia No 2 CC (1996/004451/23) is owned by the Faucitt Family Trust. Financial analysis shows an 86% profit margin on rent charged to the group—an excessive profit extraction. This was the fraud The Second Respondent reported to the accountant on 6 June 2025.

**DR 3.6.2**  
*Windeed Printout Evidence for Villa Via Arcadia*  
Property registration confirms trust ownership. The trust has three trustees, but only two were known to the beneficiaries at the time of this application.

**DR 3.7**  
*Sixth Respondent - Strategic Logistics CC*  
Strategic Logistics CC (2008/136496/23) experienced a R5.4 million stock adjustment in 2024—stock that "just disappeared." This represents 46% of annual sales (R5.4M on R11.3M sales) and is 10 times the prior year's adjustment. The stock type matches inventory supplied by Adderory to RegimA Skin Treatments.

**DR 3.7.2**  
*Windeed Printout Evidence for Strategic Logistics*  
Property registration documents. In a SARS audit email concerning the R5.4M stock adjustment, Rynette claimed that The Second Respondentie Bantjies instructed her to make the huge payments related to this transaction.

**DR 3.8**  
*Seventh Respondent - FirstRand Bank (FNB)*  
FNB holds accounts for the companies. On 14 and 15 February 2025, unauthorized transfers of R450,000 each (R900,000 total) were made from RegimA SA's FNB account without The Second Respondent's authority as co-director. The account opened with R997,597.94 and closed at R5,284.08 within one month, despite 169 customer deposits totaling R566,598.57 proving active trade.

**DR 3.9**  
*Eighth and Ninth Respondents*  
ABSA Bank and CIPC are cited. Rynette may have opened 8 ABSA accounts using The Second Respondent's information without authorization. Revenue diversion for RegimA Worldwide began with an ABSA bank letter dated 14 April 2025.

**DR 3.11**  
*Reference to Respondents as Wife and Son*  
The Applicant refers to The First Respondent and The Second Respondent as "my wife" and "my son." Both are beneficiaries of the Faucitt Family Trust. The First Respondent is also a co-trustee. The Trust Property Control Act Section 9(1) requires trustees to act with care, diligence, and skill in the interests of beneficiaries.

**DR 3.13**  
*Court Jurisdiction and Identity Confirmation*  
Jurisdiction confirmed. The affidavit is commissioned by The Second Respondentie Bantjies, who signs as "Commissioner of Oaths." Bantjies's accounting firm is "Bantjes and Company." His full relationship to the trust and companies will emerge through the evidence.

---

### RESPONSE TO AD PARAGRAPH: ACCOUNTANT'S CONFLICT OF INTEREST

**DR 4**  
*Accountant Details - Bantjes and Company*  
The Applicant identifies "our accountant" as The Second Respondentie Jacobus Bantjies of "Bantjes and Company," who attended the office in mid-June 2025. What The Applicant does not disclose: (1) Bantjies is the third trustee of the Faucitt Family Trust—a status unknown to beneficiaries The Second Respondent and The First Respondent; (2) Bantjies is a debtor to the trust, owing R18.685 million on an investment payout schedule (May 2026, 2027, 2029); (3) Bantjies controls the financial systems and gave instructions to Rynette for multi-million rand transactions; (4) Bantjies was "running the companies" when The Second Respondent exposed Villa Via fraud on 6 June 2025; (5) Bantjies dismissed The Second Respondent's audit request on 10 June 2025, claiming he was "going on holiday." This creates an impermissible conflict: Trustee + Debtor + Accountant + Company Controller. Bantjies had a direct financial interest in preventing discovery of the fraud The Second Respondent reported.

---

### RESPONSE TO AD PARAGRAPHS: PARTIES AND STRUCTURE

**DR 6.1**  
*Relationships Between Parties*  
The Applicant describes family and corporate relationships. The evidence shows a different control structure: Rynette controlled all bank accounts (The Applicant had no access), controlled the Sage accounting system using The Applicant's email (pete@regima.com), and claimed to act under Bantjies's instructions rather than The Applicant's. Rynette's sister Linda was employed as bookkeeper, yet two years of expenses remained unallocated until 30 March 2025.

**DR 6.3**  
*Directors and Members of Respondent Entities*  
The Applicant describes directorships. Key facts: The First Respondent and The Second Respondent are co-directors of RegimA SA and RegimA Worldwide Distribution (RWD). RWD is owned by the Faucitt Family Trust. On 30 March 2025, Rynette and The Applicant dumped two years of unallocated expenses into RWD and demanded The Second Respondent sign off within 12 hours for SARS VAT and Annual Accounts. The Second Respondent used this deadline extension (until 6 June) to finalize reports and uncover the Villa Via fraud.

**DR 6.5**  
*Banking and Registration of Respondent Entities*  
The Applicant describes banking arrangements. The evidence shows: (1) The Applicant had no access to any bank accounts; (2) Rynette controlled all accounts; (3) Revenue diversion for RegimA SA started 1 March 2025; (4) Revenue diversion for RWD started 14 April 2025 (ABSA bank letter); (5) On 11 September 2025, R1.73 million was transferred from accounts—six months after sabotage began, The Second Respondent was still managing to pay creditors.

---

### RESPONSE TO AD PARAGRAPHS: URGENCY AND ALLEGED MISCONDUCT

**DR 7**  
*Urgency and Delay Considerations*  
The Applicant claims urgency. The timeline reveals: (1) Alleged discovery mid-June 2025; (2) Application filed August 2025; (3) Two-month delay contradicts urgency. The actual urgency relates to The Second Respondent's fraud exposure on 6 June and The First Respondent's debt inquiry on 15 May.

**DR 7.13**  
*Domain and Service Halts Due to Card Cancellations*  
The Applicant claims subscriptions were halted due to card cancellations. To prevent business collapse, The Second Respondent substituted his personal card (1927) for RegimA SA and The First Respondent her personal card (3212) for RegimA Zone. Meanwhile, the competing domain regimaskin.co.za was actively diverting customers.

**DR 7.16**  
*Son's Interference with Business Operations*  
The Applicant alleges The Second Respondent interfered with operations. The evidence shows The Second Respondent built and managed 51+ Shopify stores generating R34.9 million annually. The Second Respondent's partner Kayla Pretorius co-built these operations before her murder on 13 July 2023. After Kayla's death, a court order was obtained to seize her email account (kayp@rzo.io), which interfered with a law enforcement investigation that had instructed a freeze on the account.

**DR 7.18**  
*Email and Account Access Interference*  
The Applicant claims The Second Respondent restricted email access. The evidence shows: (1) The Applicant had no access to his own email (pete@regima.com)—controlled by Rynette; (2) Sage screenshots from June and August 2025 show Rynette using The Applicant's email; (3) Rynette claimed to act under Bantjies's instructions, not The Applicant's; (4) Kayla's email was seized by court order after her murder.

---

### 7. RESPONSE TO AD PARAGRAPHS 7.1-7.20: DISCOVERY OF FINANCIAL IRREGULARITIES

**DR 7.1** I confirm that I provided comprehensive reports to Mr. Bantjies on **6 June 2025**, exposing the fraud involving Villa Via Arcadia No 2 CC. Mr. Bantjies, as the Applicant's accountant and a concealed trustee, had a duty to investigate these claims. Instead, he dismissed my request for an audit.

**Jax's Notes:**
> (IMPORTANT + DETAIL LATER)
> (IMPORTANT + DETAIL LATER)


**DR 7.2** The Applicant's claim that discrepancies were "noted" in July is false. I reported them on 6 June 2025. The Applicant's immediate cancellation of 15 business credit cards on **7 June 2025** was a direct act of retaliation and sabotage.

**Jax's Notes:**
> PETER CLAIMED ONLY IN JULY TO NOTICE WHEN WE WERE TRYING TO RESOLVE WITH SARS AUDIT AND INTERNAL REPORTS   INSERT REPORTS
> PETER CLAIMED ONLY IN JULY TO NOTICE WHEN WE WERE TRYING TO RESOLVE WITH SARS AUDIT AND INTERNAL REPORTS   INSERT REPORTS


**DR 7.3** The IT expenses were legitimate and necessary for the R34.9 million e-commerce operation I built. The true irregularities, which I reported, were the R5.4 million stock adjustment, the R900,000 unauthorized transfers, and Villa Via's 86% profit extraction.

**Jax's Notes:**
> THIS IS A COMPLETE MISCHARACTERISATION TO TRY AND CLAIM URGENCY AND TO MOVE PROXIMITY WITH THE DATES THAT ARE MONTHS OUT.
> THIS IS A COMPLETE MISCHARACTERISATION TO TRY AND CLAIM URGENCY AND TO MOVE PROXIMITY WITH THE DATES THAT ARE MONTHS OUT.


**DR 7.4** My conduct was professional and transparent. I built a profitable global business. The Applicant's characterization of my conduct as "erratic" is a self-serving attempt to justify his retaliatory actions.

**DR 7.5.1** The Applicant's claim that payments were "unexplained" is false. I provided comprehensive reports on 6 June 2025.

**DR 7.5.2** The card cancellations on 7 June 2025 were a manufactured crisis designed to create the pretext for this application.

**DR 7.5.3** The Applicant's cancellation of his own card was punitive theater, designed to create the illusion of a genuine crisis.

**DR 7.6** The Applicant's claim that transactions remain "unexplained" is false. The reports I provided on 6 June 2025 contained all necessary explanations.

**DR 7.7** The service interruptions were a direct and foreseeable consequence of the Applicant's own actions.

**DR 7.8** The Applicant's allegation that I "refused to assist" is false. I had already provided comprehensive assistance on 6 June 2025.

**Jax's Notes:**
> UNFORTUNATELY NEITHER DAN NOR MYSELF HAD CONTROL OF ANY OF THE ACCOUNTS AS THESE WERE CONTROLLED BY RYNETTE FARRAR, BOOKKEEPER.
> UNFORTUNATELY NEITHER DAN NOR MYSELF HAD CONTROL OF ANY OF THE ACCOUNTS AS THESE WERE CONTROLLED BY RYNETTE FARRAR, BOOKKEEPER.


**DR 7.9** The communications in Annexure PF7 demonstrate my professionalism in the face of the Applicant's manufactured crisis.

**DR 7.10** The communications with my personal assistant were necessary because the Applicant had created a crisis that required immediate attention.

**DR 7.11** The Applicant's claim that I "would or could not provide relevant invoices" is contradicted by the comprehensive reports I provided on 6 June 2025.

**DR 7.12** The interference came from the Applicant and his agents, who systematically sabotaged the business operations.

**DR 7.13.1** My email and system access was revoked in retaliation for exposing financial misconduct.

**DR 7.13.2** The selective restoration of access was controlled by Ms. Farrar, who was acting under the Applicant's instructions.

**DR 7.14** The "continued interference" was a systematic campaign of sabotage orchestrated by the Applicant's agents.

**DR 7.15** The conduct "not in the interests of the corporations" was the Applicant's dismantling of a profitable R34.9 million operation.

**DR 7.16.1** The First Respondent's action to obtain duplicate cards was necessary to prevent the total collapse of the business.

**DR 7.16.2** The use of personal credit cards to maintain business operations demonstrates the Applicant's bad faith.

**DR 7.17.1** The First Respondent defended my professional and transparent conduct.

**DR 7.17.2** The Applicant's characterization of the First Respondent's response is a misrepresentation.

**DR 7.18.1** I deny receiving a R500,000 "birthday gift." This is a false and unsupported allegation.

**DR 7.18.2** The Applicant's reference to the First Respondent's income is irrelevant and designed to undermine her.

**DR 7.18.3** Any transfer would have been a legitimate business transaction, not a personal gift.

**DR 7.19** The Applicant had full visibility of all financial transactions through his agents, Ms. Farrar and Mr. Bantjies.

**DR 7.20** My remuneration included performance-based compensation for managing the R34.9 million e-commerce operation.

---

**DR 8.1** The IT expenses were necessary for the R34.9 million global e-commerce operation I built.

**DR 8.2** The expense categories are standard for a global e-commerce business.

**DR 8.3** The expense amounts are proportional to the revenue generated.

**DR 8.6** The IT vendors are legitimate and well-known providers of e-commerce services.

**DR 8.7** I provided comprehensive documentation of all IT expenses on 6 June 2025.

**DR 8.8** International payments are a standard part of a global e-commerce business.

**DR 8.9** The bank messages regarding foreign exchange limits are standard notifications.

**DR 8.10** The true financial irregularities are the R5.4 million stock adjustment, the R900,000 unauthorized transfers, and Villa Via's 86% profit extraction.

---

### 9. RESPONSE TO AD PARAGRAPHS 9.1-9.4: FINANCIAL MISCONDUCT SUMMARY

**DR 9.1** The Applicant's summary is an inversion of the facts.

**DR 9.2** The bank message is a standard notification, not evidence of misconduct.

**DR 9.3** The actual misconduct includes the R5.4 million stock adjustment, the R900,000 unauthorized transfers, and Villa Via's 86% profit extraction.

**DR 9.4** The financial impact of the Applicant's misconduct is substantial.

---

---

### RESPONSE TO AD PARAGRAPHS STARTING WITH 10

**DR 10.5.2**  
*Probation Relief Under Section 162*  
The Applicant seeks probation under Section 162. This section requires consideration of conflicts of interest. The evidence reveals: Bantjies (Trustee + Debtor + Accountant) commissioned this affidavit as Commissioner of Oaths. Bantjies had R18.685M reasons to prevent discovery of the fraud The Second Respondent reported.

**DR 10.6.1**  
*Member's Duty to Manage in Corporation's Interest*  
The Applicant cites duty to manage in corporation's interest. The R5.4M stock adjustment in Strategic Logistics represents 46% of annual sales—10 times the historical adjustment. Rynette claimed Bantjies instructed the payments. This transaction was not in Strategic Logistics' interest.

**DR 10.6.2**  
*Member's Duty Not to Exceed Powers*  
The Applicant cites duty not to exceed powers. The unauthorized R900,000 transfers from RegimA SA (14-15 Feb 2025) were made without The Second Respondent's authority as co-director. The Applicant exceeded his powers by acting unilaterally.

**DR 10.6.3**  
*Member's Duty to Avoid Conflicts of Interest*  
The Applicant cites duty to avoid conflicts. The evidence reveals multiple conflicts: (1) Bantjies: Trustee + Debtor + Accountant; (2) Rynette's son (Adderory) supplying stock to RegimA Skin Treatments while same stock type "disappeared" from Strategic Logistics; (3) Villa Via (trust-owned) charging 86% profit margin rent to group; (4) Regimaskin.co.za (owned by Rynette's son) competing with RegimA operations.

**DR 10.7.1.4**  
*Liability for Loss Suffered by Corporation*  
The Applicant cites liability for corporate loss. The losses suffered: (1) RegimA SA: R900K unauthorized transfers, revenue diversion starting 1 Mar 2025, Shopify data expunged 22 May 2025; (2) RegimA Zone: Customer diversion to competing domain, card cancellation sabotage; (3) Strategic Logistics: R5.4M stock "disappeared"; (4) RegimA Worldwide: Forced to pay 2 years of unallocated expenses from all companies.

**DR 10.8.1**  
*Declaration of Delinquency as Alternative Relief*  
The Applicant seeks delinquency declaration. The evidence supports declaring The Applicant delinquent under Section 162(5): (1) Intentional harm to companies (systematic sabotage); (2) Grossly negligent conduct (card cancellation without notice); (3) Breach of trust (attacking beneficiaries as trustee); (4) Abuse of process (ex parte order based on material non-disclosures and false statements).

**DR 10.10.2.4**  
*Conduct with Oppressive or Prejudicial Result*  
The Applicant alleges conduct with prejudicial result. The prejudicial results: (1) The First Respondent excluded from companies after investigating fraud; (2) The Second Respondent excluded from R34.9M operations he built; (3) Customers diverted to competing domain owned by Rynette's son; (4) R900K transferred without authorization; (5) R5.4M stock "disappeared"; (6) R1,035,000 owed to Kayla's estate unpaid.

**DR 10.10.22**  
*Business Conducted in Oppressive Manner*  
The Applicant alleges oppressive business conduct. The oppressive conduct: (1) Rynette controlled all systems using The Applicant's email while claiming to act under Bantjies's instructions; (2) The Applicant had no access to email, bank accounts, or accounting systems; (3) Two years of expenses unallocated despite employed bookkeeper; (4) Bantjies (Trustee + Debtor + Accountant) dismissed fraud investigation.

**DR 10.10.41**  
*Conduct Inconsistent with Duties*  
The Applicant alleges conduct inconsistent with duties. The conduct inconsistent with duties: (1) Trustee attacking beneficiaries (The Applicant, Bantjies); (2) Director making unauthorized transfers (The Applicant); (3) Trustee dismissing fraud investigation (Bantjies); (4) Accountant facilitating fraud while being debtor (Bantjies); (5) Administrator controlling systems while diverting revenue (Rynette).

**DR 10.14**  
*Full Extent of Transgressions Not Yet Determined*  
The Applicant claims full extent not yet determined. The full extent includes: (1) Bantjies's undisclosed trustee status; (2) Bantjies's R18.685M debt; (3) Rynette's control of The Applicant's email; (4) Rynette's son's competing domain; (5) Adderory's stock supply relationship; (6) R5.4M stock transfer pricing scheme; (7) Court order seizing Kayla's email during law enforcement investigation; (8) Possible 8 ABSA accounts opened using The Second Respondent's information.

### 11. RESPONSE TO AD PARAGRAPHS 11.1-11.9: UK OPERATIONS

**DR 11.1** I built and funded the UK e-commerce operations through my company, RegimA Zone Ltd.

**DR 11.2** RegimA Zone Ltd is an independent entity, not under RegimA UK Ltd.

**DR 11.3** I have operational control and funding of RegimA Zone Ltd.

**DR 11.4** The Applicant had no operational involvement in the UK e-commerce operations.

**DR 11.5** I built and own RegimA Zone Ltd independently.

**DR 11.6** UK bank records show that RegimA Zone Ltd continuously paid for the South African Shopify platforms.

**DR 11.7** The reference to Isaac Chesno is irrelevant.

**DR 11.8** The Applicant's fear of non-payment is contradicted by bank records.

**DR 11.9** The Applicant's claim of no financial knowledge is inconsistent with his trustee powers.

---

### RESPONSE TO AD PARAGRAPHS STARTING WITH 12

**DR 12.1**  
*UK Branch Non-Payment and Fraud Concerns*  
The Applicant alleges UK branch non-payment and fraud. The Shopify invoices (DF5-DF7) prove the opposite: UK entities funded SA operations to the tune of R84,661+ annually. UK bank transactions corroborate the invoices. The Applicant's statement is demonstrably false—perjury.

**DR 12.2**  
*Misappropriation Leading to Insolvency Risk*  
The Applicant alleges misappropriation leading to insolvency. The actual insolvency risk was created by: (1) R900K unauthorized transfers; (2) Revenue diversions (1 Mar, 14 Apr); (3) Data expungement (22 May); (4) Card cancellation (7 June); (5) Warehouse sabotage (8 July); (6) Account emptying (11 Sep). Despite six months of sabotage, The Second Respondent was still managing to pay creditors until the accounts were emptied.

**DR 12.3**  
*Purpose of Court Application*  
The Applicant states the purpose is to prevent further harm. The actual purpose: (1) Punish The First Respondent for investigating R1,035,000 debt (15 May); (2) Punish The Second Respondent for exposing Villa Via fraud (6 June); (3) Seize control of R34.9M operations The Second Respondent built; (4) Prevent forensic audit that would expose Bantjies's conflicts and the systematic fraud.

**DR 12.4**  
*Alternative Roles for Wife and Son*  
The Applicant suggests alternative roles for The First Respondent and The Second Respondent. The evidence shows: (1) The First Respondent fulfilled trustee duties by investigating fraud; (2) The Second Respondent built and managed R34.9M profitable operations; (3) Both were systematically sabotaged after investigating/exposing fraud; (4) Both were attacked with interdict by co-trustees The Applicant and Bantjies; (5) The First Respondent was included in interdict two days after signing "Main Trustee" document.

---

### RESPONSE TO AD PARAGRAPHS STARTING WITH 13

**DR 13.2**  
*Clear Right Not to Be Prejudiced*  
The Applicant claims clear right not to be prejudiced. The Applicant has no clear right: (1) He manufactured the crisis (card cancellation day after The Second Respondent's cooperation); (2) He made unauthorized R900K transfers; (3) He had alternative remedies as trustee with "additional powers"; (4) He obtained order through material non-disclosures (Bantjies's trustee status, debtor status, timeline manipulation, UK payment flow perjury).

**DR 13.2.2**  
*Injury Sustained and Apprehension of Further Harm*  
The Applicant claims injury and apprehension of harm. The Applicant suffered no injury he didn't inflict on himself: (1) Card cancellation rendered documentation inaccessible; (2) Unauthorized transfers depleted accounts; (3) Revenue diversions reduced cash flow; (4) Warehouse sabotage destroyed operations. The apprehension of further harm was manufactured to justify ex parte relief.

**DR 13.3**  
*Reasonable Apprehension of Irreparable Harm*  
The Applicant claims reasonable apprehension of irreparable harm. The irreparable harm was inflicted by The Applicant's six-month sabotage campaign: (1) R34.9M operations destroyed (93.3% revenue collapse); (2) Customer relationships diverted to competing domain; (3) Audit data expunged (100% loss); (4) Documentation rendered inaccessible; (5) Accounts emptied. The Second Respondent and The First Respondent suffered irreparable harm, not The Applicant.

**DR 13.4**  
*Interdicts Essential for Corporation Survival*  
The Applicant claims interdicts essential for survival. The corporations were profitable under The Second Respondent's management (R34.9M annually). The survival threat came from The Applicant's sabotage: (1) Unauthorized transfers; (2) Revenue diversions; (3) Data destruction; (4) Card cancellations; (5) Warehouse sabotage; (6) Account emptying. Excluding The Second Respondent and The First Respondent threatened survival, not ensured it.

**DR 13.5**  
*Balance of Convenience Favours Granting Relief*  
The Applicant claims balance of convenience favors relief. The balance overwhelmingly favors The Second Respondent and The First Respondent: (1) They built and managed profitable operations; (2) They investigated and exposed fraud; (3) They were systematically sabotaged for doing so; (4) They substituted personal cards to prevent business collapse; (5) They support independent forensic audit. The Applicant obtained relief through material non-disclosures and false statements.

**DR 13.8**

**DR 14.1**  
*Financial Constraints on Respondents*  
The Applicant seeks financial constraints on The First Respondent and The Second Respondent. The financial constraints were already imposed through sabotage: (1) R900K unauthorized transfers; (2) Revenue diversions; (3) Data expungement; (4) Card cancellations; (5) Warehouse sabotage; (6) Account emptying. Despite six months of sabotage, The Second Respondent was still managing to pay creditors.

**DR 14.3**  
*Constraint to Prevent Financial Prejudice*  
The Applicant seeks constraints to prevent prejudice. The prejudice was inflicted by The Applicant: (1) RegimA SA account opened R997,597.94, closed R5,284.08 (Feb-Mar 2025); (2) 169 customer deposits R566,598.57 proving active trade; (3) R1.73M transferred 11 Sep 2025; (4) R34.9M operations destroyed by warehouse sabotage.

**DR 14.4**  
*Forensic Audit Necessity and Remuneration*  
The Applicant seeks forensic audit. The Second Respondent and The First Respondent support independent forensic audit by impartial party. Such audit would reveal: (1) Bantjies's conflicts (Trustee + Debtor + Accountant); (2) R5.4M stock transfer pricing scheme (SLG → Adderory → RST); (3) R1,035,000 debt to Kayla's estate; (4) Two years unallocated expenses; (5) Unauthorized R900K transfers; (6) Revenue diversion scheme; (7) Rynette's control of systems using The Applicant's email.

**DR 14.5**  
*Request for Relief Under Part B*  
The Applicant requests Part B relief. The relief should include: (1) Setting aside ex parte order obtained through material non-disclosures; (2) Independent forensic audit; (3) Investigation of Bantjies's conflicts; (4) Investigation of R5.4M stock "disappearance"; (5) Recovery of R1,035,000 owed to Kayla's estate; (6) Investigation of Rynette's control and Adderory's role; (7) Consideration of The Applicant's delinquency under Section 162(5).

### RESPONSE TO AD PARAGRAPHS STARTING WITH 16

**DR 16.1**  
*Discovery of Respondents' Conduct*  
The Applicant claims discovery of conduct in mid-June 2025. The actual discovery: (1) 15 May: The First Respondent discovered R1,035,000 debt to Kayla's estate; (2) 6 June: The Second Respondent exposed Villa Via fraud to Bantjies; (3) 7 June: The Applicant cancelled cards (day after The Second Respondent's cooperation); (4) 10 June: Bantjies dismissed audit request. The Applicant's "discovery" was actually consciousness of guilt after The Second Respondent exposed fraud to Bantjies.

**DR 16.2**  
*R600,000 Transfer as Trigger for Action*  
The Applicant cites R600,000 transfer (later corrected to R500,000) as trigger. The actual triggers: (1) 15 May: The First Respondent confronted Rynette about R1,035,000 debt and "profiting from proceeds of murder"; (2) 6 June: The Second Respondent exposed Villa Via fraud to Bantjies (unknowingly to perpetrator); (3) 10 June: Bantjies dismissed audit request. The R500,000 transfer is a pretext.

**DR 16.5**  
*Unawareness of Urgent Application Process*  
The Applicant claims unawareness of urgent process. The Applicant had access to legal advice and Bantjies as Commissioner of Oaths. The delay from mid-June to August contradicts urgency. The actual urgency: preventing forensic audit that would expose Bantjies's conflicts and systematic fraud.

**DR 16.6**  
*Delay Would Have Been Avoided*  
The Applicant claims delay would have been avoided if he knew the process. The two-month delay (mid-June to August) contradicts urgency. The timing suggests: (1) Waiting to see if The Second Respondent's audit request would proceed; (2) Coordinating with Bantjies (who dismissed audit request 10 June); (3) Preparing The First Respondent's punishment (included in interdict 13 Aug, two days after signing "Main Trustee" document 11 Aug).

**DR 16.8**  
*State of Shock and Delayed Response*  
The Applicant claims state of shock. The Applicant was not in shock—he was executing a systematic sabotage campaign: (1) 14-15 Feb: R900K unauthorized transfers; (2) 1 Mar: Revenue diversion started; (3) 30 Mar: Expense dumping; (4) 14 Apr: Bank letter for revenue diversion; (5) 7 Jun: Card cancellation; (6) 8 Jul: Warehouse sabotage; (7) 11 Sep: Account emptying. This is not shock—this is systematic execution.

**DR 16.10**  
*Attorney Consultation Timeline*  
The Applicant describes attorney consultation. The consultation occurred after: (1) The First Respondent's debt inquiry (15 May); (2) Data expungement (22 May); (3) Domain theft (29 May); (4) The Second Respondent's fraud exposure (6 June); (5) Card cancellation (7 June); (6) Bantjies's audit dismissal (10 June). The legal action was retaliation, not discovery.

**DR 16.12**  
*Need for Urgent Court Assistance*  
The Applicant claims need for urgent assistance. The Applicant had alternative remedies: (1) Trustee with "additional powers" as Founder; (2) Could have conducted audit as trustee; (3) Could have consulted with co-trustee The First Respondent (instead, he attacked her); (4) Could have consulted with co-trustee Bantjies (who was facilitating the fraud). The Applicant chose ex parte process to avoid disclosure of Bantjies's conflicts and systematic sabotage.

**DR 17.3**  
*Ex Parte Basis for Application*  
The Applicant justifies ex parte application. The ex parte process was abused through material non-disclosures: (1) Bantjies's trustee status; (2) Bantjies's R18.685M debt; (3) Timeline manipulation (card cancellation day after cooperation); (4) UK payment flow perjury (claimed SA → UK, actually UK → SA); (5) R34.9M revenue context omission; (6) The First Respondent's debt inquiry and retaliation pattern; (7) The Second Respondent's fraud exposure and retaliation pattern; (8) Rynette's control of The Applicant's email; (9) Adderory's competing domain; (10) R5.4M stock "disappearance."

**DR 17.4**  
*Urgency Justifies Ex Parte Relief*  
The Applicant claims urgency justifies ex parte relief. The urgency was manufactured: (1) Two-month delay contradicts urgency; (2) Card cancellation day after cooperation shows consciousness of guilt; (3) Systematic sabotage from Feb-Sep shows premeditation; (4) The First Respondent included two days after signing document shows coordination; (5) Alternative remedies available as trustee. The ex parte relief was obtained to prevent The Second Respondent and The First Respondent from exposing the material non-disclosures and systematic fraud.
