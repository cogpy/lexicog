## Executive Summary

This version integrates critical findings from the rzonedevops/analysis repository, which provides irrefutable evidence that:

1. **Jax Faucitt is the victim**, not the perpetrator
2. A **hidden empire** of 51+ Shopify stores, 1100+ B2B tenants, and 4 distributors was concealed
3. **Systematic evidence destruction** occurred within 7 days of fraud exposure
4. **Family network control** (Rynette + Adderory) consolidated financial and digital infrastructure
