## Key Principles

### 1. Court Has No Discretion

**Critical Finding:** Once the grounds in Section 162(5) have been established, **a court has no discretion but to declare a director delinquent**.

> "Further, once the grounds in section 162(5) have been established, a court has no discretion but to declare a director delinquent – a severe sanction for misconduct that serves as both a deterrent and protection for companies."

### 2. Grounds for Delinquency Declaration

**Section 162(5) Grounds:**

A court **must** declare a director delinquent if they:

1. **Acted in a manner that amounted to gross negligence**
2. **Wilful misconduct**
3. **Breach of trust**

...in performing their functions and duties to the company.

### 3. Fiduciary Duty Breaches

**From Supreme Court of Appeal (SCA) decision in *Msibithi Investments and Others v African Legend Investment and Others* [2025] ZASCA 61:**

> "The judgment distils the core of delinquency under section 162(5)(c)(iv): egregious breaches of fiduciary duties that are neither technical nor trivial are sanctionable."

**Key Point:** The breaches must be:
- **Egregious** (extremely bad or shocking)
- **Not technical** (not mere technicalities)
- **Not trivial** (substantial and serious)

### 4. Statutory Remedy Purpose

**Section 162 provides:**
- A crucial remedy for companies where director's fiduciary duties are breached
- Acts as both a **deterrent** and **protective mechanism**
- Once proved, court has no discretion but to order declaration

## Case Study: African Legend Investment

### Facts

In a sprawling governance dispute, the SCA declared Mr. Mashudu Ramano (Director) delinquent for seven years under Section 162(2)(a) read with Section 162(5)(c)(iv) and Section 162(6)(b).

### Grounds for Delinquency

**Based on Section 162(5)(c)(iv):** Gross negligence, wilful misconduct, or breach of trust as breaches of fiduciary duties.

### Specific Breach: Misrepresentation to the Board

**What Happened:**
- Director misrepresented to the board that OTS56's attorneys believed a letter from Glencore gave OTS56 an entitlement
- This misrepresentation influenced the board's decision-making
- Constituted breach of fiduciary duty

**Key Fiduciary Duty Breached:**
- Directors must use their best endeavors to fulfill conditions
- Must avoid conduct that could delay or adversely affect satisfaction of conditions
- Must not take action or make statements reasonably likely to be prejudicial to success of transactions

## Application to Peter's Conduct

### Potential Grounds for Delinquency Declaration

Based on the research, Peter's conduct may satisfy multiple grounds under Section 162(5):

#### 1. Gross Negligence
- Failed to properly oversee financial operations
- Allowed R5.4M stock adjustment without proper investigation
- Permitted two years of unallocated expenses

#### 2. Wilful Misconduct
- Deliberately cancelled 15 business credit cards to sabotage operations
- Manufactured crisis to justify ex parte application
- Concealed material facts from Court (breach of uberrima fides)

#### 3. Breach of Trust
- Breached fiduciary duty to act in company's best interests
- Used trust and company structures to attack beneficiary Daniel
- Sabotaged R34.9M operation for personal vendetta

### Egregious Nature of Breaches

Peter's breaches are:
- **Egregious:** Deliberately manufactured crisis causing R34.9M operational damage
- **Not technical:** Substantive breaches of fiduciary duties
- **Not trivial:** Caused massive financial harm and business disruption

---

## Court's Mandatory Duty

**Critical Point:** If the grounds are established, the court **must** declare Peter delinquent. There is no discretion.

This is a powerful remedy that:
1. Removes Peter from director positions
2. Bans him from holding director position for at least 7 years (or life in serious cases)
3. Protects companies from further harm
4. Serves as deterrent to others

## Next Steps for Research

1. Obtain full text of Section 162(5) of Companies Act 71 of 2008
2. Research additional case law on delinquency declarations
3. Identify specific subsections that apply to Peter's conduct
4. Map evidence to each statutory ground
5. Draft comprehensive Counter-Application
