The primary ground for this application is that Peter, while a director, acted in a manner that amounted to **gross negligence, wilful misconduct, or breach of trust**.

As established in the preceding research, once these grounds are proven, the court **has no discretion** and **must** declare the director delinquent. The evidence presented below will form the factual basis for the Counter-Application.

## 4. Detailed Analysis of Grounds and Evidence

### 4.1. Wilful Misconduct

**Definition:** A deliberate and intentional act of wrongdoing.

**Peter's Actions:**
- **Sabotage of Operations:** The cancellation of 15 credit cards was a deliberate act designed to cripple the company's R34.9M e-commerce operation. This was a direct and retaliatory response to receiving Dan's reports on financial misconduct.
- **Manufacturing Urgency:** Peter knowingly created a crisis and then used that crisis as the basis for an urgent ex parte application, misleading the court about the true nature of the situation.
- **Material Non-Disclosures:** The concealment of Bantjies's conflicts, the true timeline, and the self-created urgency were deliberate acts of deception.

### 4.2. Gross Negligence

**Definition:** A conscious and voluntary disregard of the need to use reasonable care, which is likely to cause foreseeable grave injury or harm to persons, property, or both.

**Peter's Actions:**
- **Financial Mismanagement:** Allowing a R5.4 million stock adjustment without investigation and permitting two years of unallocated expenses demonstrates a reckless disregard for his duties as a director.
- **Failure to Supervise:** Peter's failure to supervise Rynette and Bantjies, despite being aware of the financial irregularities, constitutes gross negligence.

### 4.3. Breach of Trust

**Definition:** Any act or omission on the part of a trustee which is not authorized or excused by the trust instrument or by law.

**Peter's Actions:**
- **Abuse of Fiduciary Position:** As a Trustee of the Faucitt Family Trust, Peter had a duty to act in the best interests of the beneficiaries. Instead, he used his position to attack a beneficiary (Daniel) who exposed wrongdoing.
- **Collusion with Conflicted Parties:** Peter's reliance on Bantjies, a conflicted party, for the "independent" investigation is a clear breach of his duty to act in the company's best interests.

## 5. Conclusion

The evidence overwhelmingly demonstrates that Peter Faucitt has acted in a manner that constitutes gross negligence, wilful misconduct, and breach of trust. His actions were not only detrimental to the company but were also calculated to mislead the court and attack a whistleblower. The court, upon being presented with this evidence, will be compelled under Section 162(5) to declare him a delinquent director.

**Next Step:** Outline the complete Counter-Application strategy, incorporating the relief sought, and then compile the required annexures.
