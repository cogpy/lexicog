## 1. Introduction

This document outlines the comprehensive legal strategy for the Counter-Application to be filed in response to the ex parte application brought by Peter Faucitt (Peter). The strategy is twofold:

1.  **Defensive:** To set aside the ex parte order obtained by Peter through material non-disclosures and abuse of process.
2.  **Offensive:** To seek substantive relief against Peter and his associates for their misconduct, including a declaration of delinquency against Peter under Section 162(5) of the Companies Act 71 of 2008.

This strategy is designed to not only neutralize the immediate threat posed by the ex parte order but also to hold the responsible parties accountable for their actions and protect the interests of the companies and their stakeholders.

## 3. Legal Basis for Each Relief Sought

### 3.1. Setting Aside the Ex Parte Order

*   **Legal Basis:** Breach of the duty of *uberrima fides* (utmost good faith), material non-disclosures, and self-created urgency.
*   **Argument:** Peter obtained the ex parte order by misleading the court. He failed to disclose:
    *   The true timeline of events (Dan's reports on June 6, card cancellations on June 7).
    *   The self-created nature of the urgency (the crisis was a direct result of his own actions).
    *   The multiple conflicts of interest of his key witness, Danie Bantjies.
*   **Outcome:** The court will be asked to set aside the order as it was obtained through an abuse of process.

### 3.2. Declaration of Delinquency (Peter Faucitt)

*   **Legal Basis:** Section 162(5)(c) of the Companies Act 71 of 2008.
*   **Argument:** Peter's conduct amounts to gross negligence, wilful misconduct, and breach of trust. The evidence will show:
    *   **Wilful Misconduct:** Deliberate sabotage of the company, manufacturing a crisis, and misleading the court.
    *   **Gross Negligence:** Failure to oversee financial operations, allowing massive financial irregularities.
    *   **Breach of Trust:** Abusing his position as Trustee to attack a beneficiary and colluding with conflicted parties.
*   **Outcome:** The court will be asked to declare Peter delinquent, which is a mandatory order once the grounds are proven.

### 3.3. Independent Forensic Audit

*   **Legal Basis:** The court's inherent jurisdiction to make orders that are just and equitable, and in the best interests of the company.
*   **Argument:** The financial affairs of the companies are in disarray due to Peter's mismanagement. An independent audit is necessary to:
    *   Uncover the full extent of the financial irregularities.
    *   Protect the interests of the company and its stakeholders.
    *   Provide a factual basis for further legal action.
*   **Outcome:** The court will be asked to appoint a reputable and independent auditor to ensure a fair and impartial investigation.

### 3.4. Investigation of Danie Bantjies

*   **Legal Basis:** The court's power to refer matters to the appropriate regulatory bodies.
*   **Argument:** Mr. Bantjies's conduct raises serious ethical and legal questions. His multiple conflicting roles make him unfit to act in any capacity related to this matter. An investigation by the CIPC is necessary to determine the extent of his misconduct.
*   **Outcome:** The court will be asked to refer the matter to the CIPC for a full investigation.

### 3.5. Recovery of Funds Owed to Kayla's Estate

*   **Legal Basis:** The court's power to grant relief in respect of related matters.
*   **Argument:** The R1,035,000 owed to Kayla's estate is a legitimate debt that has been unlawfully withheld. This is part of a broader pattern of financial misconduct.
*   **Outcome:** The court will be asked to order the immediate payment of this amount.

### 3.6. Punitive Costs

*   **Legal Basis:** The court's discretion to award costs on a punitive scale in cases of egregious conduct.
*   **Argument:** Peter's conduct in bringing this application has been vexatious, malicious, and an abuse of the court process. A punitive costs order is warranted to censure his conduct.
*   **Outcome:** The court will be asked to order Peter to pay costs on the highest possible scale.

## 4. Strategic Considerations

*   **Unified Narrative:** The Counter-Application will present a unified and coherent narrative that exposes the full extent of the misconduct by Peter and his associates.
*   **Evidence-Based:** Every claim will be supported by clear and compelling evidence, as mapped out in the evidence mapping document.
*   **Proactive Stance:** The Counter-Application moves from a defensive posture to a proactive one, seeking to hold the wrongdoers accountable.
*   **Focus on Delinquency:** The delinquency declaration is the central pillar of the strategy, as it will remove Peter from his position of power and protect the companies from further harm.
