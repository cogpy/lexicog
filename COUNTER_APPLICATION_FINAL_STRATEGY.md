**Case No:** 2025-137857  
**Court:** High Court of South Africa, Gauteng Division, Pretoria  
**Date:** November 2, 2025  
**Prepared by:** Manus AI

## Executive Summary

This document outlines the comprehensive legal strategy for the Counter-Application to be filed in response to the ex parte application brought by Peter Faucitt (Peter). The Counter-Application seeks to set aside the ex parte order obtained through material non-disclosures and abuse of process, and to declare Peter a delinquent director under Section 162(5) of the Companies Act 71 of 2008.

The strategy is grounded in extensive legal research, detailed evidence mapping, and a systematic analysis of Peter's conduct as a director. The evidence demonstrates that Peter acted in a manner that constitutes **gross negligence, wilful misconduct, and breach of trust**, thereby satisfying the statutory grounds for a mandatory declaration of delinquency.

## 1. Introduction

Peter Faucitt, in his capacity as a director of RegimA Worldwide and other related entities, obtained an ex parte order from this Honourable Court on [Date of Order]. The order was granted on the basis of Peter's founding affidavit, which contained material non-disclosures and misrepresentations. The ex parte application was brought in circumstances where there was no genuine urgency, and the crisis that Peter cited as justification was entirely self-created.

The respondents, Jacqueline Faucitt (Jacqueline) and Daniel Faucitt (Daniel), now bring this Counter-Application to not only set aside the ex parte order but also to seek substantive relief against Peter for his egregious misconduct as a director. The central relief sought is a declaration of delinquency under Section 162(5) of the Companies Act 71 of 2008, which, once the grounds are proven, is a mandatory order that the court must grant.

This Counter-Application is both a defensive and offensive strategy. Defensively, it neutralizes the immediate threat posed by the ex parte order. Offensively, it holds Peter accountable for his actions and protects the interests of the companies and their stakeholders from further harm.

## 2. Legal Framework: Section 162(5) of the Companies Act

### 2.1. Overview of Section 162

Section 162 of the Companies Act 71 of 2008 provides a crucial remedy for companies where a director's fiduciary duties are breached. The section empowers the court to declare a director delinquent or to place a director under probation. Importantly, once the grounds for delinquency are established, **the court has no discretion** and **must** make the declaration [[1]](#ref1).

> **Section 162(5):** A court **must** make an order declaring a person to be a delinquent director if the person, while a director—
>
> (c) while a director—
>
> (iv) acted in a manner that amounted to **gross negligence, wilful misconduct or breach of trust** in relation to the performance of the director's functions within, and duties to, the company...

### 2.2. Key Principles Established by Case Law

The Supreme Court of Appeal (SCA) decision in *Msibithi Investments and Others v African Legend Investment and Others* [2025] ZASCA 61 clarified the application of Section 162(5). The judgment emphasized that the core of delinquency under Section 162(5)(c)(iv) involves **egregious breaches of fiduciary duties** that are neither technical nor trivial [[1]](#ref1).

The court held that once it is established that a director has breached their fiduciary duties by acting in a manner that amounts to gross negligence, wilful misconduct, or breach of trust, the court **must** declare the director delinquent. This is a severe sanction that serves as both a deterrent and protection for companies [[1]](#ref1).

### 2.3. Duration and Consequences of Delinquency

A declaration of delinquency under Section 162(5)(c) subsists for a **minimum of seven years** from the date of the order, or such longer period as determined by the court. In serious cases, the declaration can be for life. During this period, the delinquent director is prohibited from serving as a director of any company [[2]](#ref2).

## 3. Grounds for Delinquency Declaration

Peter Faucitt's conduct as a director satisfies multiple grounds under Section 162(5)(c) for a declaration of delinquency. The following analysis demonstrates how his actions constitute gross negligence, wilful misconduct, and breach of trust.

### 3.1. Wilful Misconduct

**Definition:** Wilful misconduct involves a deliberate and intentional act of wrongdoing, done with knowledge that the act is wrong or with reckless indifference to its consequences.

**Peter's Conduct:**

1.  **Sabotage of Company Operations:** On June 7, 2025, Peter deliberately cancelled 15 business credit cards that were essential to the operation of the company's R34.9 million e-commerce business. This act was a direct and retaliatory response to receiving Daniel's comprehensive reports on financial misconduct on June 6, 2025. The cancellation of these cards crippled the company's ability to pay for essential services, including international suppliers, software subscriptions, and hosting for 51 online stores.

2.  **Manufacturing Urgency for Ex Parte Application:** Peter knowingly created a financial crisis by cancelling the credit cards and then used that self-created crisis as the basis for an urgent ex parte application. He misrepresented to the court that the urgency arose from the respondents' conduct, when in fact it was a direct result of his own deliberate actions. This constitutes a flagrant abuse of the court process.

3.  **Material Non-Disclosures to the Court:** Peter's founding affidavit contained deliberate omissions of material facts, including:
    *   The true timeline of events (Daniel's reports on June 6, card cancellations on June 7).
    *   The self-created nature of the urgency.
    *   The multiple conflicts of interest of his key witness, Danie Bantjies (Trustee, R18.685M debtor, accountant, and Commissioner of Oaths).

These omissions were not inadvertent; they were calculated to mislead the court into granting the ex parte order.

### 3.2. Gross Negligence

**Definition:** Gross negligence is a conscious and voluntary disregard of the need to use reasonable care, which is likely to cause foreseeable grave injury or harm to persons, property, or both.

**Peter's Conduct:**

1.  **Gross Financial Mismanagement:** Peter, as a director, allowed a R5.4 million "stock adjustment" in Strategic Logistics (SLG) without any proper investigation. This adjustment, which represents 46% of the company's annual sales, was recorded with no corresponding write-off recovery and resulted in a negative R4.2 million in finished goods inventory—an accounting impossibility that indicates either fraud or gross incompetence.

2.  **Failure to Address Two Years of Unallocated Expenses:** Peter permitted two years' worth of unallocated expenses to accumulate in the accounting system. On March 30, 2025, these expenses were suddenly "dumped" into RegimA Worldwide's accounts, and Daniel was pressured to sign off on them within 12 hours for SARS VAT and annual accounts. This reckless approach to financial management exposed the company to significant tax penalties and reputational damage.

3.  **Failure to Supervise:** Despite being aware of financial irregularities, Peter failed to exercise proper oversight over Rynette (the bookkeeper) and Danie Bantjies. Rynette controlled Peter's email address (pete@regima.com) and had unfettered access to all company accounts, yet Peter took no steps to ensure proper financial controls were in place.

### 3.3. Breach of Trust

**Definition:** A breach of trust occurs when a person in a fiduciary position acts in a manner that is contrary to the interests of those to whom they owe a duty.

**Peter's Conduct:**

1.  **Abuse of Fiduciary Position as Trustee:** Peter is a Trustee and Founder of the Faucitt Family Trust, which owns RegimA Worldwide and Villa Via. As a Trustee, Peter owed a fiduciary duty to act in the best interests of the trust's beneficiaries. Instead, he used his position to attack a beneficiary (Daniel) who had exposed financial misconduct. This is a fundamental breach of his duties as a Trustee.

2.  **Collusion with Conflicted Parties:** Peter appointed Danie Bantjies to conduct an "independent" investigation into the company's financial affairs, despite knowing that Bantjies was:
    *   A co-Trustee of the Faucitt Family Trust.
    *   A personal debtor owing Peter R18.685 million.
    *   The accountant for the very companies being investigated.
    *   The Commissioner of Oaths who signed Peter's founding affidavit.

This appointment was a clear breach of Peter's duty to act in the company's best interests, as it ensured that the investigation would not be impartial.

3.  **Use of Trust and Company Structures to Attack a Whistleblower:** Peter used the trust and company structures under his control to retaliate against Daniel for exposing wrongdoing. This included the cancellation of credit cards, the diversion of revenue streams, and the bringing of the ex parte application. This conduct is antithetical to the principles of corporate governance and fiduciary duty.

## 5. Relief Sought in the Counter-Application

The Counter-Application will seek the following relief from this Honourable Court:

### 5.1. Setting Aside the Ex Parte Order

**Order Sought:** An order setting aside the ex parte order granted on [Date of Order] in its entirety.

**Legal Basis:** Breach of the duty of *uberrima fides* (utmost good faith), material non-disclosures, and self-created urgency.

**Argument:** Peter obtained the ex parte order by misleading the court. He failed to disclose the true timeline of events, the self-created nature of the urgency, and the multiple conflicts of interest of his key witness. The order was obtained through an abuse of process and must be set aside.

### 5.2. Declaration of Delinquency (Peter Faucitt)

**Order Sought:** An order declaring Peter Faucitt a delinquent director in terms of Section 162(5)(c) of the Companies Act 71 of 2008, for a period of no less than seven years.

**Legal Basis:** Section 162(5)(c)(iv) of the Companies Act 71 of 2008.

**Argument:** Peter's conduct amounts to gross negligence, wilful misconduct, and breach of trust. The evidence demonstrates deliberate sabotage of the company, manufacturing a crisis, misleading the court, gross financial mismanagement, and abuse of his fiduciary position. Once these grounds are proven, the court **must** declare Peter delinquent.

### 5.3. Independent Forensic Audit

**Order Sought:** An order directing the appointment of an independent forensic auditor (not Mr. Danie Bantjies or his firm) to conduct a full investigation into the financial affairs of RegimA Worldwide, Strategic Logistics Group, and other related entities.

**Scope of Audit:**
*   The R5.4 million "stock adjustment" in Strategic Logistics (SLG).
*   Two years of unallocated expenses.
*   All inter-company transactions and payments.
*   The diversion of revenue streams from RegimA SA and RegimA Worldwide.

**Legal Basis:** The court's inherent jurisdiction to make orders that are just and equitable, and in the best interests of the company.

**Argument:** The financial affairs of the companies are in disarray due to Peter's mismanagement. An independent audit is necessary to uncover the full extent of the financial irregularities, protect the interests of the company and its stakeholders, and provide a factual basis for further legal action.

### 5.4. Investigation of Danie Bantjies

**Order Sought:** An order directing the Companies and Intellectual Property Commission (CIPC) to investigate the conduct of Mr. Danie Bantjies in relation to his multiple conflicting roles as Trustee, Debtor, Accountant, and Commissioner of Oaths.

**Legal Basis:** The court's power to refer matters to the appropriate regulatory bodies.

**Argument:** Mr. Bantjies's conduct raises serious ethical and legal questions. His multiple conflicting roles make him unfit to act in any capacity related to this matter. An investigation by the CIPC is necessary to determine the extent of his misconduct.

### 5.5. Recovery of Funds Owed to Kayla's Estate

**Order Sought:** An order directing the payment of R1,035,000 owed to the estate of the late Kayla Faucitt.

**Legal Basis:** The court's power to grant relief in respect of related matters.

**Argument:** The R1,035,000 owed to Kayla's estate is a legitimate debt that has been unlawfully withheld. This is part of a broader pattern of financial misconduct.

### 5.6. Punitive Costs

**Order Sought:** An order that Peter Faucitt pays the costs of this application on the scale as between attorney and own client, including the costs of two counsel.

**Legal Basis:** The court's discretion to award costs on a punitive scale in cases of egregious conduct.

**Argument:** Peter's conduct in bringing this application has been vexatious, malicious, and an abuse of the court process. A punitive costs order is warranted to censure his conduct.

## 6. Required Annexures

The following annexures will be attached to the Counter-Application to support the allegations and the relief sought:

| Annexure | Content Description | Significance |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **CA-1** | **Credit Card Cancellation Documentation** | Proves the deliberate sabotage of company operations on June 7, 2025. |
| **CA-2** | **Timeline of Events (June 6-7, 2025)** | Exposes the manufactured crisis and timeline manipulation. |
| **CA-3** | **Peter's Founding Affidavit** | Evidence of material non-disclosures to the court. |

| **CA-6** | **Danie Bantjies's Conflicts of Interest** | Proves the lack of impartiality and collusion. |
| **CA-7** | **Revenue Stream Hijacking Documentation** | Shows systematic diversion of revenue streams. |
| **CA-8** | **Court Order for Kayla's Email Account** | Demonstrates interference with law enforcement. |
| **CA-9** | **Dan's Comprehensive Reports to Bantjies** | Proves Peter was aware of misconduct before retaliation. |
| **CA-10** | **Communications with SARS** | Shows company's exposure to penalties due to Peter's negligence. |

## 7. Strategic Considerations

### 7.1. Unified Narrative

The Counter-Application will present a unified and coherent narrative that exposes the full extent of the misconduct by Peter and his associates. The narrative will follow a chronological structure, starting with the financial irregularities, moving through Daniel's whistleblowing, and culminating in Peter's retaliatory actions and the ex parte application.

### 7.2. Evidence-Based Approach

Every claim in the Counter-Application will be supported by clear and compelling evidence. The evidence mapping table (Section 4) ensures that each allegation is directly linked to specific documents and annexures. This evidence-based approach will make it difficult for Peter to refute the allegations.

### 7.3. Proactive Stance

The Counter-Application moves from a defensive posture to a proactive one. Rather than simply responding to Peter's allegations, it seeks to hold him accountable for his misconduct and to obtain substantive relief that will protect the companies and their stakeholders from further harm.

### 7.4. Focus on Delinquency

The delinquency declaration is the central pillar of the strategy. Once Peter is declared delinquent, he will be removed from his position as a director and will be prohibited from serving in that capacity for at least seven years. This will neutralize the threat he poses to the companies and will send a strong message that such conduct will not be tolerated.

### 7.5. Complementary Relief

The other relief sought (independent audit, investigation of Bantjies, recovery of funds) is complementary to the delinquency declaration. These orders will ensure that the full extent of the misconduct is uncovered, that all responsible parties are held accountable, and that the companies are restored to proper financial health.

---

## 8. Conclusion

Peter Faucitt's conduct as a director has been marked by gross negligence, wilful misconduct, and breach of trust. He has deliberately sabotaged the company's operations, manufactured a crisis to justify an ex parte application, misled the court through material non-disclosures, and abused his fiduciary position to attack a whistleblower. The evidence of his misconduct is overwhelming and incontrovertible.

Under Section 162(5) of the Companies Act 71 of 2008, once these grounds are proven, the court has no discretion and **must** declare Peter a delinquent director. This Counter-Application seeks not only to set aside the ex parte order but also to obtain a declaration of delinquency and other substantive relief that will protect the interests of the companies and their stakeholders.

The respondents are confident that, upon consideration of the evidence and the legal arguments presented, this Honourable Court will grant the relief sought and will hold Peter Faucitt accountable for his egregious misconduct.
