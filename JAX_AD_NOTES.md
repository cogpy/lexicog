## Section 4: Urgency and Delay Considerations (AD 7-7.20)

| AD Paragraph | Commentary |
|:-------------|:-----------|
| **AD 7** - Urgency and Delay Considerations | THERE IS NO REASON FOR THE URGENCY FOR THE APPLICANT. THERE IS, HOWEVER, REASON FOR URGENCY ON THE PART OF JACQUI & DANIEL AS THERE IS FINANCIAL IMPACT DUE TO PETER'S ACTIONS AND HE ALLOWING RYNETTE FARRAR BOOKKEEPER DO ALL BANKING TRANSACTIONS. ON A DAILY BASIS THIS BOOKKEEPER TRANSFERS FUNDS BETWEEN ACCOUNTS AND JACQUI & DANIEL ARE UNABLE TO SEE ANY OF THESE ACCOUNTS |
| **AD 7.3** - Urgency Details | THERE WAS NO URGENCY ON THE PART OF THE APPLICANT. HOWEVER, THERE HAS BEEN, AND CONTINUES TO BE MASSIVE IMPACT ON REGIMA SKIN TREATMENTS AS THE BOOKKEEPER DOES NOT KNOW ANYTHING ABOUT MY COMPANY AND IS ACTUALLY CAUSING HARM. THERE WAS AN ANNUAL PRICE INCREASE DUE, USUALLY DONE BY DANIEL, WHO IS A MATHEMATICIAN, AND INSTEAD THE BOOKKEEPER HAS DONE IT AND CAUSED DREADFUL HARM TO THE STRUCTURE OF HOW THIS INCREASE IS CARRIED OUT.<br><br>IT IS NOTEWORTHY THAT I, JACQUI FAUCITT, C.E.O., LAUNCHED REGIMA SKIN TREATMENTS 33 YEARS AGO AND HAVE BUILT UP THE COMPANY TO BE ONE OF SOUTH AFRICA'S MOST SUCCESSFUL SKIN TREATMENT COMPANIES, HAVING WON ALL THE MAJOR INDUSTRY AWARDS. EVERY WORD EVER WRITTEN ABOUT THE REGIMA SKIN TREATMENTS HAS BEEN WRITTEN BY JACQUI FAUCITT. REGIMA IS ALSO SOLD OVERSEAS AND IS EXTREMELY SUCCESSFUL. I, JACQUI, HAVE TREATED THOUSANDS OF PATIENTS, REFERRED FROM LEADING PLASTIC SURGEONS, TREATING MAINLY SCARRING AND BURNS AS WELL AS REJUVENATION WITH OUR SLOGAN BEING "PRODUCTS THAT CHANGE LIVES" THERE IS NOBODY AT THE REGIMA OFFICE BUILDING WHO CAN TREAT PATIENTS, ONLY ME. |
| **AD 7.6** - Financial Impact of Misconduct | NOT TRUE TO THE APPLICANT, HOWEVER, THERE IS IMPACT TO OUR ENTITIES, AS CONFIRMED BY E-MAILS BETWEEN OURSELVES AND BANTJIES. BANTJIES SUPPORTING AFFIDAVIT WHICH WAS COMPLETELY FALSE (INSERT REPORT) |

**7.8** UNFORTUNATELY NEITHER DAN NOR MYSELF HAD CONTROL OF ANY OF THE ACCOUNTS AS THESE WERE CONTROLLED BY RYNETTE FARRAR, BOOKKEEPER AND HAVE BEEN SINCE THE INTERDICT, WHICH IS DAMAGING ALL THE ENTITIES ON A DAILY BASIS AS Ms FARRAR DOES NOT APPEAR TO KNOW HOW TO RUN BUSINESSES.

IT IS NOTEWORTHY THAT PETER DOES NOT USE A COMPUTER WHATSOEVER. HE DOES NOT DO ANY OF THE BANKING WHATSOEVER, HE ALLOWS THE BOOKKEEPER TO DO ABSOLUTELY ALL BANK TRANSACTIONS
