**Coverage:** AD Paragraphs 7-17

## Section 4: Urgency and Delay (AD 7-7.20)

| AD Para | Title | Jax's Commentary |
|:--------|:------|:-----------------|
| AD 7 | Urgency Claim | Peter claimed urgency only in July during SARS audit resolution. There was a 67-day delay between Daniel's reports (June 6) and the interdict application (August 13). This contradicts any claim of urgency. |
| AD 7.1 | Accountant Discovery | The "accountant" is Danie Jacobus Bantjies of Bantjes and Company. What Peter fails to disclose is that Bantjies is an undisclosed trustee of the Faucitt Family Trust, owes R18.685M to the trust (payout schedule: May 2026, 2027, 2029), and gave instructions to Rynette for multi-million rand transactions. Daniel exposed Villa Via fraud to Bantjies on June 6, 2025. Bantjies dismissed Daniel's audit request on June 10, 2025, claiming he was "going on holiday." |
| AD 7.2-7.20 | Financial Irregularities | Peter characterizes the situation as urgent, but the actual urgency was for the respondents who were experiencing financial impact from Peter's actions. Rynette was doing all banking transactions daily while Jacqui and Daniel were unable to see any accounts. This had a massive impact on RegimA Skin Treatments, where Jacqui has been CEO for 33 years. |

### Key Points - Urgency and Delay

**No Urgency for Peter:**
- 67-day delay between Daniel's cooperation (June 6) and interdict application (August 13)
- Mischaracterization of timeline to manufacture urgency

**Actual Urgency for Respondents:**
- Financial impact from Peter's systematic sabotage
- Rynette controlling all banking transactions daily
- Jacqui and Daniel unable to access any accounts
- Massive operational impact on RegimA Skin Treatments

**Jacqui's Essential Role:**
- CEO for 33 years
- Built one of South Africa's most successful skin treatment companies
- Won all major industry awards
- Only person at office who can treat patients
- Essential as Responsible Person for UK/European business operations

**Systematic Sabotage:**
- All card cancellations by Peter alone in secret
- Rynette took RegimA logo and registered in her son's name
- Cancelled regima.zone email addresses
- Instructed database administrator to use regimaskin.co.za instead
- Peter instructed cancellation of Shopify and automation systems

## Section 5: Financial Discrepancies and Misconduct (AD 8.4-9.3)

| AD Para | Title | Jax's Commentary |
|:--------|:------|:-----------------|
| AD 8.4 | IT Expenses 2024 | Peter claims R6,738,007.47 in IT expenses for 2024 are "almost entirely unexplainable." This deliberately omits critical context: these expenses supported 51+ Shopify stores generating R34.9 million annually (RegimA SA: 25 stores, R8.5M turnover; RegimA Zone: 26 stores, R26.4M turnover). When contextualized, the IT expenses represent 19.3% of revenue - reasonable operational costs for a global e-commerce platform. |
| AD 8.5 | IT Expenses 2025 | Peter claims R2,116,159.47 in IT expenses for 2025 are unexplainable. These expenses represent 6.1% of the R34.9M annual revenue - well within reasonable operational costs for e-commerce operations. Peter deliberately omitted the revenue context to create a misleading impression of excessive spending. |
| AD 8.6 | Unexplained Payments | Peter alleges payments are unexplained, but fails to disclose that Rynette controlled the accounting system using Peter's email (pete@regima.com), and that two years of expenses remained unallocated despite Rynette's sister Linda being employed as bookkeeper and Bantjies serving as accountant. The question is: Why were expenses unallocated for two years if these professionals were performing their duties? |
| AD 8.7-8.10 | International Transfers | Peter implies a SA → UK payment flow, suggesting South African companies were funding UK operations. The evidence proves the opposite: UK → SA flow of R84,661+ annually. Daniel's UK company (RegimA Zone Ltd, UK 10697009) funded SA operations. This is a demonstrable misrepresentation. |
| AD 9.1-9.3 | Financial Misconduct | The actual financial misconduct includes: (1) R900,000 in unauthorized transfers from RegimA SA FNB account on February 14-15, 2025, without Daniel's authority as co-director; (2) R5.4M stock "disappeared" from Strategic Logistics - the same type of stock supplied by Adderory (Rynette's son's company); (3) R1,035,000 owed to Kayla Pretorius's estate since February 2023, with Rynette falsely claiming the debt was paid. |

### Key Points - Financial Discrepancies

**Bantjies's Conflict of Interest:**
- Undisclosed trustee of Faucitt Family Trust
- Debtor owing R18.685M to the trust (payout: May 2026, 2027, 2029)
- Controller of financial systems
- Recipient of Daniel's fraud report (June 6, 2025)
- Dismissed audit request (June 10, 2025)
- His "discovery" of irregularities occurred after fraud was exposed to him
- Certified Peter's affidavit as Commissioner of Oaths despite these conflicts

**Two Years of Unallocated Expenses:**
- Controlled by Rynette using Peter's email (pete@regima.com)
- Linda (Rynette's sister) employed as bookkeeper
- Bantjies was the accountant
- Critical question: Why unallocated if professionals were performing duties?
- Dumped into RegimA Worldwide on March 30, 2025
- Daniel given 12 hours to sign off for SARS VAT & Annual Accounts

**IT Expenses Context:**
- Peter claims R6.7M (2024) and R2.1M (2025) "unexplainable"
- Actually supported 51+ Shopify stores generating R34.9M annually
- Represents 19.3% (2024) and 6.1% (2025) of revenue
- Reasonable for global e-commerce operation
- Peter deliberately omitted revenue context

**International Payment Flow Truth:**
- Peter implies SA → UK payment flow
- Evidence proves UK → SA (R84,661+ annually)
- UK company (RegimA Zone Ltd) funded SA operations
- Demonstrable misrepresentation in founding affidavit

**Actual Financial Misconduct:**
- R900,000 unauthorized transfers (February 14-15, 2025)
- R5.4M stock "disappeared" from Strategic Logistics
- Same stock type supplied by Adderory (Rynette's son)
- R1,035,000 owed to Kayla's estate since February 2023
- Rynette falsely claimed debt was paid

## Section 6: Delinquency Application (AD 10.1-10.14)

| AD Para | Title | Jax's Commentary |
|:--------|:------|:-----------------|
| AD 10.1-10.14 | Delinquency Grounds | Peter seeks delinquency declarations against Jacqui and Daniel based on alleged financial mismanagement. However, the evidence shows: (1) Daniel built profitable R34.9M annual operations; (2) Jacqui fulfilled fiduciary duties as trustee by investigating R1,035,000 debt to Kayla's estate; (3) Both were punished for fulfilling their duties - Jacqui confronted Rynette on May 15, and data was expunged on May 22 (7 days later); Daniel exposed fraud on June 6, and cards were cancelled on June 7 (1 day later). |

### Key Points - Delinquency Application

**Grounds for Delinquency:**
- Peter alleges gross abuse of position (Section 162(5)(c)(ii))
- Peter alleges intentional or grossly negligent harm (Section 162(5)(c)(iii))
- Peter alleges gross negligence, wilful misconduct, breach of trust (Section 162(5)(c)(iv))

**Counter-Evidence:**
- Daniel built R34.9M annual operations (profitable, not harmful)
- Jacqui fulfilled fiduciary duties by investigating debt
- Both punished for fulfilling duties, not for misconduct
- Systematic sabotage by others, not by respondents

**Timeline of Retaliation:**
- May 15: Jacqui confronts Rynette about R1,035,000 debt
- May 22: Shopify data expunged (7 days later)
- May 29: Domain regimaskin.co.za registered by Adderory (14 days later)
- June 6: Daniel exposes Villa Via fraud to Bantjies
- June 7: 15 cards cancelled by Peter (1 day later)
- June 10: Bantjies dismisses audit request (4 days later)
- July 8: Warehouse operations stopped

## Section 7: UK Operations (AD 11.2-12.4)

| AD Para | Title | Jax's Commentary |
|:--------|:------|:-----------------|
| AD 11.2-11.9 | UK Entity Ownership | Peter makes claims about UK operations, but fails to disclose: (1) UK companies are owned by Daniel Faucitt, not by Peter or the trust; (2) Daniel personally funded all Shopify stores, proven by bank records and invoices; (3) Peter has no role whatsoever in UK entities and does not own any UK entities; (4) Only Jacqui and Daniel are essential for UK operations. |
| AD 12.1-12.4 | UK Payment Direction | Peter claims SA companies funded UK operations. The truth is the opposite: Daniel paid for all UK business with personal cards. Bank records and Shopify invoices prove UK → SA payment flow of R84,661+ annually. This is a material misrepresentation in the founding affidavit. |

### Key Points - UK Operations

**Ownership and Funding:**
- UK companies owned by Daniel Faucitt (RegimA Zone Ltd, UK 10697009)
- Daniel personally funded Shopify stores
- Proven by bank records and invoices
- Independent of RegimA UK Ltd

**Peter's Non-Role:**
- No role whatsoever in UK entity
- Does not own any UK entities
- Only Jacqui and Daniel essential for UK operations
- Peter has no access to UK systems

**Payment Direction Truth:**
- Daniel paid for all UK business with personal cards
- Opposite of Peter's claims in affidavit
- UK → SA flow: R84,661+ annually
- Shopify invoices corroborate UK bank transactions

## Section 8: Interdictory Relief (AD 13.2-13.8)

| AD Para | Title | Jax's Commentary |
|:--------|:------|:-----------------|
| AD 13.2-13.8 | Interdict Requirements | Peter seeks an interdict to prevent Jacqui and Daniel from conducting business. However, the interdict is based on material non-disclosures: (1) Bantjies's undisclosed trustee status and R18.685M debt; (2) False statements about UK payment flows; (3) Timeline manipulation to create false urgency; (4) Omission of revenue context for IT expenses. The interdict was granted ex parte on August 13, 2025, two days after Jacqui was deceived into signing a "Main Trustee" document on August 11, 2025 (backdated to July 1, 2025). |

### Key Points - Interdictory Relief

**Material Non-Disclosures:**
- Bantjies's undisclosed trustee status
- Bantjies's R18.685M debt to the trust
- False statements about UK payment flows (SA → UK vs. actual UK → SA)
- Timeline manipulation to create false urgency
- Omission of revenue context for IT expenses (R34.9M operations)

**Deception and Timing:**
- August 11: Jacqui deceived into signing "Main Trustee" document
- Document backdated to July 1, 2025
- August 13: Interdict granted (2 days later)
- Pattern of deception and immediate legal action

## Section 9: Financial Constraints and Preservation (AD 14.1-14.5)

| AD Para | Title | Jax's Commentary |
|:--------|:------|:-----------------|
| AD 14.1-14.5 | Preservation Orders | Peter seeks preservation orders claiming financial constraints. However, the actual financial constraints were caused by Peter's own actions: (1) Card cancellations on June 7, 2025; (2) Revenue diversions starting March 1, 2025 (RegimA SA) and April 14, 2025 (RegimA Worldwide); (3) Warehouse sabotage on July 8, 2025; (4) Account emptying on September 11, 2025 (R1.73M transferred). Daniel was still paying creditors despite 6 months of sabotage, so the accounts were emptied to prevent continued operations. |

### Key Points - Financial Constraints

**Peter's Actions Created Constraints:**
- Card cancellations (June 7, 2025)
- Revenue diversions (March 1 and April 14, 2025)
- Warehouse sabotage (July 8, 2025)
- Account emptying (September 11, 2025 - R1.73M)

**Daniel's Continued Operations:**
- Still paying creditors despite 6 months of sabotage
- Accounts emptied to prevent continued operations
- Demonstrates Daniel's commitment and capability
- Contradicts Peter's allegations of mismanagement

## Section 10: Discovery and Urgency (AD 16.1-16.12)

| AD Para | Title | Jax's Commentary |
|:--------|:------|:-----------------|
| AD 16.1-16.12 | Discovery Timeline | Peter claims urgency based on recent discovery. However, the timeline shows: (1) Daniel exposed fraud to Bantjies on June 6, 2025; (2) Bantjies dismissed audit request on June 10, 2025; (3) Peter's "discovery" occurred after Daniel's fraud exposure; (4) 67-day delay between Daniel's cooperation and interdict application contradicts urgency. The real urgency was for Peter to prevent further discovery of fraud. |

### Key Points - Discovery and Urgency

**Discovery Timeline:**
- June 6: Daniel exposes fraud to Bantjies
- June 10: Bantjies dismisses audit request
- Peter's "discovery" occurs after Daniel's fraud exposure
- 67-day delay contradicts urgency claim

**Real Urgency:**
- Prevent further discovery of fraud
- Silence Jacqui and Daniel
- Protect Bantjies's R18.685M debt
- Protect Rynette's control structure

## Section 11: Ex Parte Basis (AD 17.3-17.4)

| AD Para | Title | Jax's Commentary |
|:--------|:------|:-----------------|
| AD 17.3-17.4 | Ex Parte Justification | Peter justifies ex parte application claiming risk of evidence destruction. However, the evidence was already destroyed: (1) Shopify data expunged on May 22, 2025; (2) Peter cancelled cards on June 7, 2025, rendering documentation inaccessible; (3) Peter created the problem he complains about. This constitutes venire contra factum proprium - acting contrary to one's own previous conduct. |

### Key Points - Ex Parte Basis

**Evidence Already Destroyed:**
- Shopify data expunged (May 22, 2025)
- Cards cancelled by Peter (June 7, 2025)
- Documentation rendered inaccessible by Peter's own actions

**Venire Contra Factum Proprium:**
- Peter created the problem he complains about
- June 6: Daniel cooperates by providing comprehensive reports
- June 7: Peter cancels cards (1 day later)
- Then complains about missing documentation
- Legal principle: acting contrary to one's own previous conduct
