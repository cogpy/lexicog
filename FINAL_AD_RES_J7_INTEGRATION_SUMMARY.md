## Part 1: Critical Priority Integrations (Top 3)

### 1. Unjust Enrichment Claim (Daniel) - Priority 1

**Legal Principle:** Four-Element Test for Unjust Enrichment

**Application:**
- **Element 1 (Enrichment):** RWD saved R140K-R280K, received services valued R2.94M-R6.88M
- **Element 2 (At Expense Of):** RegimA Zone Ltd paid R140K-R280K, patrimony decreased
- **Element 3 (No Legal Ground):** No contract, no gift intention, no statutory entitlement
- **Element 4 (No Defense):** Cannot claim change of position, estoppel, or bona fide purchase

**Restitution:**
- **Minimum:** R140K-R280K (actual cost incurred)
- **Market Value:** R2.94M-R6.88M (market rate for equivalent services)
- **Quantum Meruit:** Reasonable remuneration for platform services

**Where to Integrate:** DR 7-8, Counter-application, RWD analysis

**Impact:** Establishes Dan's beneficial ownership or substantial restitution claim

---

### 2. Manufactured Crisis Framework (Jacqueline) - Priority 2

**Legal Principle:** Manufactured Crisis Indicators (6-8 indicators present)

**Indicators Present:**
1. **Actor created problem** - Peter cancelled cards, made documentation inaccessible, then complained
2. **Timing suspicious** - Card cancellation June 7 (day after Dan provided reports June 6)
3. **Disproportionate response** - Escalated to ex parte interdict
4. **No internal resolution** - No board meeting, discussion, or mediation
5. **Problem serves actor's interests** - Documentation gap provides litigation pretext
6. **Coordination with objectives** - Timing coincides with settlement negotiation

**Legal Consequence:** Rebuts good faith presumption, establishes bad faith, improper purpose, abuse of process

**Where to Integrate:** JR 7.2-7.5, JR 7.14-7.15, Bad faith analysis

**Impact:** Transforms narrative from "documentation problem" to "manufactured crisis for litigation advantage"

---

### 3. Trustee Conflict of Interest Prohibition (Jacqueline) - Priority 3

**Legal Principle:** Beneficiary Adverse Action Prohibition

**Application:**
- Peter is **sole trustee** of Faucitt Family Trust with absolute powers
- Jax is **beneficiary** of the trust
- Peter seeks **interdict against Jax** (adverse action against beneficiary)
- Peter's personal interests conflict with beneficiary interests

**Critical Question:** Why does Peter with absolute trust powers need court relief?  
**Answer:** Ulterior motive (harassment, leverage, delay) rather than legitimate trust administration

**Legal Consequence:** Fundamental breach of fiduciary duty, grounds for removal as trustee, taints all actions

**Where to Integrate:** JR 3-3.10, JR 11-11.5, Trust conflict analysis, Motion for removal

**Impact:** Establishes Peter's fundamental breach and provides grounds for removal as trustee

---

## Part 2: High Priority Integrations (4-6)

**Significance:** Prosecution-ready criminal evidence package (Grade A)

**Where:** JR 9, DR Fraud Report, Criminal referral

### 6. Self-Dealing Prohibition (Jacqueline)

**Principle:** s75-76 Companies Act

**Where:** JR Financial flows, Counter-allegations, Shareholder oppression
