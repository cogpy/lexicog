## Benefits of JR/DR Numbering System

### 1. Direct Traceability
- **JR 7.10** → **AD 7.10** (instant mapping)
- **DR 7.10** → **AD 7.10** (instant mapping)
- No searching required to find which AD paragraph is being addressed

### 2. Professional Structure
- Mirrors the Applicant's numbering system
- Demonstrates systematic and comprehensive response
- Court-friendly format

### 3. Cognitive Synergy
- **JR 7.5.2** and **DR 7.5.2** both address the manufactured crisis timeline
- When read together, complementary responses create emergent understanding
- Each affidavit is complete on its own, but together they are synergistic

### 4. Complete Coverage
- All 141 AD paragraphs are addressed
- No gaps in the response
- Easy verification of coverage

### 5. Sub-Paragraph Clarity
- Complex allegations broken into clear sub-points
- Example: **JR 7.5.1**, **JR 7.5.2**, **JR 7.5.3** address different aspects of AD 7.5
- Clearer argumentation and evidence presentation

---

## Structure Comparison: v7 vs v8

### v7 Affidavits (Traditional Structure)
- Grouped multiple AD paragraphs into single responses
- Example: Section 6 (paragraphs 6.1-6.6) addressed AD 7.x
- Coverage gaps: ~53% of AD paragraphs not explicitly addressed
- Difficult to verify complete coverage

### v8 Affidavits (JR/DR Structure)
- Each AD paragraph gets dedicated JR/DR response
- Example: **JR 7.1** addresses **AD 7.1**, **JR 7.2** addresses **AD 7.2**, etc.
- Complete coverage: 100% of AD paragraphs explicitly addressed
- Easy verification: JR/DR number = AD number
