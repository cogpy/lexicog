## Trust Property Control Act - Section 9: Care, Diligence and Skill

### Section 9(1) - Standard of Care

A trustee shall in the performance of his duties and the exercise of his powers act with the **care, diligence and skill** which can reasonably be expected of a person who manages the affairs of another.

**Key Principles:**
- Objective standard: reasonable person managing another's affairs
- Applies to all trustee actions and decisions
- Encompasses both duties and powers
- Non-delegable personal responsibility

### Section 9(2) - Void Exemption Clauses

Any provision contained in a trust instrument shall be **void** in so far as it would have the effect of:
- Exempting a trustee from liability for breach of trust
- Indemnifying a trustee against liability for breach of trust

Where the trustee fails to show the degree of care, diligence and skill required in subsection (1).

**Implications:**
- Trustees cannot contract out of fiduciary duties
- Trust deeds cannot provide blanket indemnification
- Protection only available if trustee met required standard
- Public policy prevents waiver of basic duties
