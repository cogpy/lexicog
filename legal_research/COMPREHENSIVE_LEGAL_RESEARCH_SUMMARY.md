## Conflict of Interest: Undisclosed Trustee

### Legal Framework

- Incentive to conceal financial irregularities
- Motivation to prevent scrutiny of trust finances
- Cannot act impartially

## Urgency Requirements for Interdicts

### Legal Test for Urgency

Applicant must establish:
1. **Circumstances of real urgency** exist
2. **Irreparable harm** will result if relief not granted immediately
3. **No alternative remedy** available
4. **Balance of convenience** favors granting relief
5. **Explanation for delay** if any time lapsed

### Peter's Urgency Claims

**Alleged Discovery:**
- Mid-June 2025: Accountant (Bantjies) noted discrepancies

- 19 August 2025: Ex parte order granted

**Time Lapse:**
- Minimum 2 months from discovery to application
- Sufficient time for inter partes application
- No explanation for delay
- No evidence of imminent irreparable harm

### Counter-Arguments on Urgency

**1. Self-Created Urgency**
- Peter cancelled cards on 7 June 2025

- Cannot rely on self-created urgency

**2. Ongoing Business Operations**

- Interdict destroys R34.9M business

- Benefits only Peter and Bantjies
- Protects fraud rather than prevents it

## Conclusion

The legal research reveals multiple grounds for challenging Peter's founding affidavit and the ex parte order granted on 19 August 2025. The material non-disclosure of Bantjies' role as undisclosed trustee with a R18.685M debt to the trust, combined with the pattern of oppressive conduct and lack of genuine urgency, provides a strong foundation for the responding affidavits. Both JR and DR affidavits should be refined to comprehensively address these legal issues with proper statutory citations and common law authority.
